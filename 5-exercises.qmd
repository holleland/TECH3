## Contingency tables problems

### Problem 1 
[Researchers](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.663611) collected data on the size of their feet for a group of right-handed male and females and counted how many of each sex had a left-foot larger than the right, equal feet or right foot larger than the left. The results are given in the table here:

|Sex | L>R | L=R | L<R|Total|
|----|-----|-----|----|-----|
|Men |2|10|28|40|
|Women|55|18|14|87|



Does the data indicate that gender has a strong effect on the development of foot asymmetry? Specify the null- and alternative hypothesis, compute the $\chi^2$ test statistic and obtain the p-value. 



### Problem 2
A company wants to assess whether customer response (Yes/No) to a marketing campaign depends on the platform used (Email, SMS, Social Media).

|Response	| Email	| SMS | Social Media|
|---------|-------|-----|-------------|
|Yes      |    120|	45  | 80          |
|No       |  	 180|	105	| 120         |

a) Formulate the null and alternative hypotheses.
b) Compute the expected frequencies.
c) Calculate the chi-squared test statistic.
d) Determine the degrees of freedom.
f) At a 5% significance level, is there evidence to suggest the response rate depends on the platform?


<!-- ### Problem 3 -->
<!-- A café records the preferred payment method (Cash, Card, Mobile Pay) of its customers, categorized by age group (18–35, 36–55, 56+). -->

<!-- |Payment Method|	18–35|	36–55|	56+| -->
<!-- |--------------|-------|-------|-----| -->
<!-- |Cash	|40	|35	|60| -->
<!-- |Card	|70	|80	|55| -->
<!-- |Mobile Pay|	90|	45|	20| -->

<!-- a) Set up a chi-squared test to assess whether payment method preference depends on age group. -->
<!-- b) Calculate the expected counts. -->
<!-- c) Comment on any trends you observe in the data. -->
<!-- d) Suggest how the café could tailor its services based on the result. -->
