## Control questions:

1.  If an increase in X is associated with an increase in Y, what sign will the correlation coefficient have?
2.  If an increase in Y is associated with an decrease in X, what sign will the correlation coefficient have?
3.  What type of dependence is described by correlations?
4.  What does zero correlation mean for the relationship between X and Y?
5.  What kind of distribution do we use in a hypothesis test of correlation?
