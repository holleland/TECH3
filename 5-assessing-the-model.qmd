## Control questions:

- What is the interpretation of $R^2=0.80$?
- If the correlation between $X$ and $Y$ is $0.5$, what is $R^2$ in the regression $Y=\beta_0+\beta_1 X+\epsilon$? 
- What are the assumptions of a linear regression?
- How do we assess whether the linearity assumption is fulfilled?
- How do we assess whether the residuals are homoskedastic (have constant variance)?
- What is QQ-plot and what do we use it for?
- Do we need normality of the errors when estimating coefficients?
- Do we need normality when making prediction intervals?
