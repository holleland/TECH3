Interpretation depends on p-value vs alpha. If our p-value is below that of 0.05, which is our current significance level, then we can reject the null hypothesis, \\(H_0\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nDescribe the distribution of a chi-squared variable with 4 degrees of freedom. (What are the mean and variance, can you find a general rule?)\n\nHint: When \\(Y\\sim\\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma^2)\\), we have that \\(E[Y^4]=3\\sigma^4\\)\n\nExplain how the chi-squared distribution arises from the standard normal distribution.\n\n\n\nShow solutions\n\n\nPositively skewed distribution, where \\(E[X]=\\mu=k\\), and \\(Var[X]=\\sigma^2= 2k\\). Let’s see how we can reach these. First, recall that if \\(X\\sim\\chi^2_k\\), then\n\n\\[\nX=\\sum^k_{i=1}Z^2_i\n\\] Where \\(Z_i\\sim iid \\mathcal{N}(0,1)\\)\nNow we can begin computing the expectation:\n\\[\nE[X]=E\\left[\\sum^k_{i=1}Z^2_i\\right]=\\sum^k_{i=1}E[Z_i^2]\n\\] Now, we can be a bit clever here. Since \\(Z\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0,1)\\), and \\(Var[Y]=E[Y^2]-(E[Y])^2\\), we get\n\\[\nE[Z^2]=Var[Z]+(E[Z])^2 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad E[Z^2]=1+0=1\n\\] This lets us fully compute the expected value for \\(X\\). We use the fact that we have identical distribution to simpify the notation.\n\\[\nE[X]=\\cdots=kE[Z^2]=k*1=k\n\\] Now we can do the same procedure with the Variance. Recall, since \\(Z_1,...,Z_k\\) are independent, we have that the variance of the sum is the sum of the variances.\n\\[\nVar[X]=Var\\left[\\sum^k_{i=1}Z^2_i\\right]=\\sum^k_{i=1}Var[Z_i^2]\n\\] Now, we again use the ralationship that \\(Var[Y]=E[Y^2]-(E[Y])^2\\). We already know that \\(E[Z^2]=1 \\Rightarrow (E[Z^2])^2=1\\). Now we need only determine \\(E[(Z^2)^2]=E[Z^4]\\). Using the hint, we have that \\(E[Z^4]=3\\sigma^4=3*1^2=3\\), and we then get:\n\\[\nVar[Z^2]=3-1=2\n\\] Now we use that we have k identical distributions to get the variance of \\(X\\) \\[\nVar[X]=\\cdots=kVar[Z^2]=k*2=2k\n\\]\n\nThe chi-sqaured distribution, as we’ve just looked at in depth, comes from the sum of squares of independent standard normal variables.\n\n\n\n\n\nA researcher models expected frequencies of customer types and compares to observed values. Expected: \\(\\{40, 35, 25\\}\\), Observed: \\(\\{38, 30, 32\\}\\) Conduct a goodness-of-fit test by hand.\n\n\nShow solutions\n\n\\[\n\\chi^2 = \\frac{(38-40)^2}{40} + \\frac{(30-35)^2}{35} + \\frac{(32-25)^2}{25} = 0.1 + 0.714 + 1.96 ≈ 2.53\n\\] \\(df=3-1=2\\)\nAt a significance level of \\(\\alpha=0.05\\) we then get a critical value of 5.99, which is higher than the test statistic. I.e. it seems the data fits the distribution well enough.\n\n\n\n\nUniversity admits 30% of male applicants and 25% of female applicants overall.

This should not be surprising, as a) gave us a VERY strong positive correlation.\n\n\n\nThere is a statistically significant and strong positive correlation between study hours and exam score. The data support the hypothesis that more study time is associated with higher performance.\n\n\n\n\n\nGive two examples where correlation does not imply causation.\nWhy are randomized experiments used?\n\n\n\nShow solutions\n\n\nReasonable examples:\n\nIce cream sales and drowning could very easily seem positively correlated. When ice cream sales go up we see more drowning, but does that mean ice cream sales lead to drowning? Seems unlikely. Let’s consider, when, both are at their peak. In the summer more people go swimming, and as such more accidents can happen, and this also happens to be the exact time of year when ice cream sales peak as well, due to heat. The scorching sun leads to higher ice cream sales and far more bathing (and consequently accidents).\n\n\n\nShoe size and reading ability, is probably positively correlated. This may not seem obvious, but consider the lower extreme. The ones that have the smallest shoes would be infants, who don’t yet have the ability to read, and at the other end you will have full grown adults that more than likely can read well. It seems far fetched to think that the size of your feet would determine your reading ability, but your age determining both your shoe size and your reading ability could veyr well be the case.\n\nThese effects on both the exposure and the outcome, we call confounders.\n\nRandomization eliminates selection bias and confounding.\n\n\n\n\n\nDescribe a scenario where a confounding variable could lead to misleading correlation.\n\n\nShow solutions\n\nExample: You may find yourself regressing prevalence of heart disease on coffee consumption, and seem to get a very strong connection. You, however, haven’t controlled for smoking habits. Without controlling for smoking, all the effects of smoking would be attempted explained by coffee-consumption, which could lead to it seeming like a far more serious contributor than what we see in practice.\n\n\n\n\nExplain the importance of random assignment in identifying causal relationships.\n\n\nShow solution\n\nRandom assignment in experiments let’s us account for both the confounders we are aware of and those we aren’t. When we randomly select enough data points we will find that known and unknown confounders will distribute more evenly across groups. Essentially we can more effectively isolate the relationship between the dependent and the independent variable in a regression.\n\n\n\n\nGiven: X = (1, 2, 3), Y = (2, 2.5, 4)\n\nEstimate intercept and slope.\nPredict Y when X = 4.\n\n\n\nShow solutions\n\n\nWe essentially treat the best fit line in a linear regression like we would any linear function, where we have a set formula for the slope, \\(hat{\\beta_1}=\\frac{\\hat{Cov(X,Y)}}{S^2_X}\\), and \\(\\hat{\\beta_0}=\\bar{Y}-\\beta_1\\bar{X}\\), and gives the intercept.\n\nWe can start by finding the averages and for \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), before we compute variance and covariacne.\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\bar{X}=\\frac{1+2+3}{3}=2, \\quad \\bar{Y}=\\frac{2+5/2+4}{3}=\\frac{17}{6} \\\\\nS^2_X=\\frac{1}{2}\\left((1-2)^2+(2-2)^2+(3-2)^2\\right)=1 \\\\\n\\hat{Cov(X,Y)}=\\frac{1}{2}(1*\\frac{5}{6}+0+1*\\frac{7}{6})=\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{12}{6}=1\n\\end{align*}\n\\] Now we can compute \\(\\hat{\\beta_1}\\) and \\(\\hat{\\beta_0}\\)\n\\[\n\\hat{\\beta_1}=\\frac{1}{1}=1, \\quad \\hat{\\beta_0}=\\frac{17}{6}-1*2=\\frac{5}{6}\n\\] And with that we have estimates for the intercept, 5/6, and slope, 1.\n\nGiven our estimated model we have\n\n\\[\nY_i=\\frac{5}{6}+X_i+\\varepsilon\n\\] What we would like now is the conditional expected value of \\(Y\\) when \\(X=4\\).

In other words, as price increases, the probability of purchase decreases.\nThe odds ratio is \\(e^{-0.5} \\approx 0.61\\). This means the odds of purchasing are multiplied by 0.61 for each $1 increase in price.\nAt price = 10:\n\n\\[\n\\log\\left(\\frac{p}{1 - p}\\right) = 3 - 0.5 \\times 10 = -2 \\Rightarrow p = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{2}} \\approx 0.12\n\\]\n\nThe logistic curve is an S-shaped curve that starts near 1 when price is low (e.g., close to $0), and decreases smoothly toward 0 as price increases.\nAs the price increases toward 20 USD, the exponent in the model becomes more negative, and the probability \\(p\\) approaches 0.

This might indicate that there are\nstrong multicollinearity or other numerical problems.\n\n\nYou test both on new data and Model A performs better.\n\nWhy might Model A outperform B despite having fewer predictors?\nWhat is overfitting?\nHow does cross-validation help avoid it?\n\n\n\nShow solutions\n\n\nModel B may have overfit noise in training data; simpler model generalizes better. Model A also has an innate advantage in that we prefer simpler models. By studyin R-squared and adjusted R-squared in both A and B we can tell that teh additional vairables don’t really help explain the realtionship.\nOverfitting: model captures noise rather than signal, reducing generalizability. The danger here is that if you can perfectly explain a sample, you may have been unlucky, and found effects that aren’t necessarily present in the entire population, no matter how rpresentative the sample.\nCross-validation assesses performance on unseen data, discouraging overfitting.I.e., you validate a model by using it on more than just the data it was built on.\n\n\n\n\n\nA model is developed to predict house prices. Another researcher claims, “This model proves that number of bedrooms causes higher prices.”\n\nIs this a valid conclusion?\nWhat’s the difference between prediction and causal inference?\nUnder what conditions could we argue causation?\n\n\n\nShow solutions\n\n\nNo, correlation is not causation. Though the model sees that more bedrooms tend to be associated with higher prices, the model itself it is made as a forecast, it is not capable of making inferences on a causal relationship.\nPrediction focuses on accurate forecasts; explanation seeks underlying causal mechanisms.\nCausation requires random assignment or strong quasi-experimental design to eliminate confounding.\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven: \\(\\text{score} = 50 + 2 \\cdot \\text{study\\_hours}\\) You calculate:\n\n95% confidence interval for mean score at 6 hours: (60, 64)\n95% prediction interval for individual score: (55, 69)\n\n\nWhat do these intervals represent?\nWhy is the prediction interval wider?\nIf we wanted to reduce the width of both, what could help?\n\n\n\nShow solutions\n\n\nCI gives a range for mean score of all students studying 6 hours; PI gives range for a new individual’s score.\nPI includes both model uncertainty and residual variability.\nIncreasing sample size reduces standard errors, narrowing both intervals.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou compare two models:\n\nModel 1: \\(R^2=0.72\\)\nModel 2: \\(R^2=0.76\\)\n\n\nCan we conclude Model 2 is better?\nWhat’s a limitation of using R² alone?\nSuggest a better metric.\n\n\n\nShow solutions\n\n\nNot necessarily; depends on context and number of predictors. The R-squared is quite similar, so that on it’s own can’t really tel the whole story.\n\\(R^2\\) can never decrease when adding more predictors, and this can be misleading. In theory, one could add a thousand predictors, all of whom barely increase the \\(R^2\\), but will in the end only help to overfit the model.\nThere are different measures, like adjusted R-squared and AIC, both of whom punish adding explanatory variables that dont contribute.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou include dummy variables for 4 regions: North, South, East, West.\n\nWhat problem arises if all 4 are included in the regression model?\nHow should this be handled?\n\n\n\nShow solutions\n\n\nThe model will have what we call perfect colinearity, which leads to the model not being able to estimate parameters due to linear dependence.\nOmit one region as reference category; remaining coefficients are interpreted relative to it. E.g. we take North as the base region, now all other dummies will display coefficients that indicate a score relative to north as a basis. (This is not common practice, but one can also omit the intercept \\(\\beta_0\\), instead of a category)\n\n\n\n\n\nA regression includes both “income” and “wealth”, which are highly correlated.\n\nWhat is multicollinearity and how does it affect regression?\nHow can it be detected?\nWhat might you do to resolve it?\n\n\n\nShow solutions\n\n\nMulticollinearity inflates standard errors, making estimates unstable, and it comes from high correlation between several explanatory variables. Perfect multicolinearity comes into play when we have two or more perfectly correlated explanatory variables (height in feet and height in cm for instance)\nCheck variance inflation factors (VIF) or the correlation matirx.\nDropping one variable or combining both into one are common fixes.\n\n\n\n\n\nA regression of \\(Y\\) on \\(X\\) shows curvature. You try \\(log(X)\\):\n\\[\nY = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\log(X)\n\\]\n\nWhy use this transformation?\nWhat does \\(\\beta_1\\) now represent?\nWhen might a log-log model be preferable?\n\n\n\nShow solutions\n\n\nTo linearise exponential-like relationships.

    "text": "Exercises\n\nProblem 1\nYou have an event your interested in studying, \\(A\\). What are the lower and upper bounds for the probability that \\(A\\) occurs? I.e.what are the lower and upper bounds of \\(P(A)\\)?\n\n\nShow solutions\n\nBy the definition of the probability of an event we know that it’s bounded both from above and below. The upper bound being that \\(A\\) is guaranteed, and the lower bound being that it is impossible. We represent this on the interval \\([0,1]\\). I.e. we know that the probability of even t \\(A\\) occurring is between \\(0\\) and \\(1\\). More compact \\(P(A)\\in[0,1]\\)\n\n\n\nProblem 2\nOne day you walk outside and overhear a person talking about the probability of an event. You hear little of what they have to say, but you do hear this person say “…this won’t have to be enough, we will have to redo this experiment many more times to be certain I am approaching the right probability.” Amazingly, some time later you hear another person mumbling to them selves about probability. “Wow, now this is a surprise. This result did not coincide with my previous beliefs at all. I will have to rethink the probability of such an event occurring”, they say.\nYou get the feeling that these two people have very different way of interpreting probability? Identify who the frequentist and who the bayesian statistician is.\n\n\nShow solutions\n\nHere, person 1 is using frequentistic methods. Person 1’s focus is entirely on getting in as many independent trials as possible to get a clear image of the probability of an event. Person 2 on the other hand has a completely different view. Person 2 obviously had an initial belief about the probability of an event, but after seeing a surprising result they were determined to update their beliefs about the probability of this event.\n\n\n\nProblem 3\nVegard is very interested in the quality of watermelons. He has decided that he wants to find out the probability of watermelons being overripe at REMA 1000. He feels he has two feasible tests he can do to find this probability, one is Bayesian in nature and one is frequentist. Vegard can either go in with an initial belief, buy a single watermelon, then update his beliefs. He can keep doing this until he is quite certain of the probability of the population. On the other hand, Vegard can buy 40 watermelons at once, check them all, and then argue for that sample being representative of the population.\nWhich method is Bayesian and which is frequentist?\n\n\nShow solutions\n\nThe first option here is Bayesian. Vegard has an initial belief on the probability of the watermelons being overripe, and then he iterates and tries to make that more exact by checking one watermelon at the time.\nThe second option is a very typical frequentist test. From the whole population, a decent chunk is tested at once, in hope that it’s a representative sample. In the representative sample overripe watermelons should have the same relative frequency as in the entire population.\n\n\n\nProblem 4\nYou have a sample space, \\(S\\), and in that sample space you have two identifiable events, \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). Can you determine a case where the probability of the intersection of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) (\\(P(A\\cap B)\\)) occurring, equals the probability of \\(A\\) (\\(P(A)\\)) occurring? Draw a Venn diagram!\n\n\nShow solutions\n\nRecall that the intersection of two events is when they both occur. I.e. for us to be in the intersection in a Venn diagram, both shapes have to cover the same area. There are infinitely variations here, but the important part is that \\(A\\) must be contained within \\(B\\). When this is the case, all of A will be intersected by \\(B\\) (we say that \\(A\\) is a subset of \\(B\\), and the notation is \\(A\\subseteq B\\)). In this case we get: \\[P(A\\cap B)=P(A)\\]\n\n\n\nProblem 5\nYou have a sample space, \\(S\\), and in that sample space you have two identifiable events, \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). Can you determine a case where the probability of the union of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) (\\(P(A\\cup B)\\)) occurring, equals the probability of \\(B\\) (\\(P(B)\\)) occurring? Draw a Venn diagram!\n\n\nShow solutions\n\nRecall that the union of two events is when either one or both events occur. This means that all area covered by either \\(A\\) or \\(B\\) will be part of the union. We now want the probability of the union occurring to equal the probability of \\(B\\) occurring. Since all area covered by either \\(A\\) or \\(B\\) is part of the union, we can have no excess are beyond \\(B\\), i.e. \\(A\\) should once again be a subset of \\(B\\) (\\(A\\subseteq B\\)). If this is the case we get: \\[P(A\\cup B)=P(B).\\]\n\n\n\nProblem 6\nConsider a situation where you have \\(0&lt;P(A)&lt;P(B)&lt;1\\).\n\nWhat are the lower and upper bounds of \\(P(A\\cap B)\\)?\nWhat are the lower and upper bounds of \\(P(A\\cup B)\\)?\n\n\n\nShow solutions\n\n\nThe intersection tells us that both \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) have to occur, and as such, we the lower one of the two gives us an upper bound, as the one event cant intersect with more than the cases where it itself occurs (draw a Venn diagram to confirm). We know nothing as to whether or not \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are disjoint, and as this is still a possibility we may not have an intersection, this makes \\(0\\) our lower bound. I.e. \\[P(A\\cap B)\\in[0, P(A)]\\]\nThe union tells us that either \\(A\\) or \\(B\\) or both occurs. As all events where either one or both occurs, the unions lower bound is given by the higher of the two probabilities. We could also be in a situation where \\(A\\cup B\\) cover the whole sample space \\(S\\), and in such a case we would have an upper bound of 1. I.e: \\[P(A\\cup B)\\in[P(B),1]\\]\n\n\n\n\nProblem 7\nWhat is \\(A\\cap B\\) when events \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are disjoint.\n\n\nShow solutions\n\nWhen the two events \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are disjoint, there are no possible situation that would fit into the intersection \\(A \\cap B\\). In set notation we would write: \\[A\\cap B=\\emptyset\\] where \\(\\emptyset\\) is called the empty set and denotes a set with no elements.\n\n\n\nProblem 8\nYou throw a fair six-sided dice, compute the probabilities of the following events.\n\nYou roll 1\nYou roll 3 or 4\nYou roll an odd number\nYou roll a number that’s greater than 5\nYou roll a number that’s less than or equal to 10\n\n\n\nShow solutions\n\nA fair 6 sided die gives us the sample space \\(S=\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}\\) with each respective outcome having the same probability to be tossed. i.e. if A is an event that denotes any one number being tossed, then: \\[\nP(A)=\\frac{1}{6}\\]\n\nRolling a 1 is a single element in the sample space, i.e. \\(P(1)=\\frac{1}{6}\\)\n3 and 4 constitute 2 possible disjoint outcomes, i.e. \\[P(3\\cup 4)=P(3)+P(4)=P\\frac{1}{6}+\\frac{1}{6}=\\frac{2}{6}=\\frac{1}{3}\\]\nThere are 3 different odd numbered outcomes\n\n\\[P(odd)=3\\cdot\\frac{1}{6}=\\frac{1}{2}\\]\n\nThere is only one possible outcome greater than 5, namely 6.

What is \\(P(A)\\)?\nLet event \\(B\\) be the complement of \\(A\\), i.e \\(B=A^c\\). What is the probability of getting \\(B\\)?\nWhat is \\(P(A\\cap B)\\)?\nCompute \\(P(A \\cup B)\\), how do you interpret this result?\n\n\n\nShow solutions\n\n\nWe treat each coin flip as independent of all the others, we then also let the probability of getting heads be \\(P(H)=\\frac{1}{2}\\) for each coin toss. Since each toss is independent we can simply multiply them all together to find our final probability:\n\n\\[ P(A)=P(HHHHH)=\\prod_{i=1}^5\\frac{1}{2}=\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^5=\\frac{1}{2^5}=\\frac{1}{32} \\]\n\n\\(B\\) being the complement of \\(A\\) means that it will occur whenever \\(A\\) doesn’t. It’s also simple to compute as we can use a nifty formula.\n\n\\[\\begin{align}P(A^c)=1-P(A) \\\\\n\\Rightarrow P(B)=P(A^c)=1-P(A)=1-\\frac{1}{32}=\\frac{31}{32}\n\\end{align}\\]\n\nSince \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are complements, they are by definition disjoint, as at no point will both occur (no intersection!!!). As such, we get a clear implication that \\(A\\cap B=\\emptyset\\) Following from this \\(P(A\\cap B)=0\\)\nFinally we can compute the union. Recall that we have a formula for this.\n\n\\[P(A \\cup B)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A\\cap B) \\]\nWe know all of the relevant probabilities needed for the computation.\n\\[ P(A \\cup B)=\\frac{1}{32}+\\frac{31}{32}-0=1 \\]\nThe probability of the union being 1 means that either \\(A\\), \\(B\\) or \\(A\\cap B\\) will occur. We already know, however that the events are disjoint, and as such there is no intersection. I.e. it’s either \\(A\\) or \\(B\\) that must occur. Interpreting this, we end up at the quite banal fact that when we do this experiment, we will* either* end up with 5 heads, or we will not (any other permutation). In fact this situation illustrates a powerful concept concerning complements of events, being that if an event does not occur, then the complement will occur.\n\n\n\nProblem 10\nLet \\(S\\) be a sample space. What is the probability of the complement of \\(S\\) (\\(P(S^c)\\))?

I.e. when we there is no chance of any event occurring that is not in the sample space.\n\n\n\nProbelm 11\nYou roll two 6 sided dice, one blue and one red.

Each of the two dice can roll from 1 to 6. Adding it all together we can construct the sample space\n\n\\[\nS=\\left\\{\n\\begin{array}{cccccc}\n(1,1),& (1,2),& (1,3),& (1,4),& (1,5),& (1,6), \\\\\n(2,1),& (2,2),& (2,3),& (2,4),& (2,5),& (2,6), \\\\\n(3,1),& (3,2),& (3,3),& (3,4),& (3,5),& (3,6), \\\\\n(4,1),& (4,2),& (4,3),& (4,4),& (4,5),& (4,6), \\\\\n(5,1),& (5,2),& (5,3),& (5,4),& (5,5),& (5,6), \\\\\n(6,1),& (6,2),& (6,3),& (6,4),& (6,5),& (6,6)\n\\end{array}\n\\right\\}\n\\]\n\nWe now consider the sum of the two dice. The lowest value is when both roll 1’s, and the highest possible one is when both roll 6’s. Every integer value between these two sums are achievable. We now end up with:\n\n\\[ S_{sum}=\\{2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12\\} \\]\n\n\nProblem 12\nYou throw two dice.\n\nIn how many outcomes is their sum less equals 6?\nWhat is the probability of getting a sum total of 2?\n\n\n\nShow solutions\n\n\nIf dice 1 rolls a 6, then the other dice will make the sum at least 7, i.e. no candidates.

Following similar logic if dice 1 rolls 1-4, then each produce 1 more candidate.\n\nIn total we end up with 5 outcomes that give us a sum of 6.\n\nFor us to have a sum of 2, we need both dice to roll 1. i.e. there is only one outcome that nets this event There are 36 possible outcomes. i.e. \\(P(sum \\ 2)=\\frac{1}{36}\\)\n\n\n\n\nProblem 13\nLet \\(A=\\{1,2,3,4,6\\}\\), \\(B=\\{2,4,6,8\\}\\), and \\(C=\\{2,3,4,5\\}\\).\n\nFind \\(A\\cap B\\cap C\\)\nFind \\(A\\cup B\\cup C\\)\n\n\nShow solutions\n\n\nRecall first that\n\n\\[ A\\cap (B\\cap C)=A\\cap B\\cap C \\]\nSo we can find the intersection simply by looking for the elements that appear in all of the sets.

Compute \\(P(A)\\).\n\n\nShow solutions\n\nTwo things are very clear when working with complements, and that’s that they are disjoint events and that the probability of one or the other occurring sum to 1 exactly. Directly following from this is that we can always make use of the law of total probability when we know the probabilities of the intersections between an event, \\(A\\), and both complements. In this case we have exactly the right information to make use of the law of total probability. Recall the formula. \\[ P(A)=\\sum_{i=1}^kP(A\\cap B_i)=P(A\\cap B_1)+\\cdots+P(A\\cap B_2) \\] Let’s use this to compute the probability\n\\[ P(A)=P(A\\cap B)+P(A\\cap B^c)=\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{3}=\\frac{3+2}{6}=\\frac{5}{6} \\]\n\n\nProblem 15\nWe have an event, \\(A\\), and we are interested in figuring out the probability of it occurring. We know the probabilities of \\(B_1,...,B_n\\) and we know that \\(\\sum_{i=1}^nP(B_i)=1\\). Why can’t we use the law of total probability here? What could go wrong? (It might help to draw a Venn diagram if you’re struggling.)\n\n\nShow solutions\n\nThe problem here is that we don’t know if \\(B_1,...,B_n\\) are disjoint events, and since, there may be areas where they intersect with each other, we run the risk of counting some space several times if we were to sum all intersections between \\(A\\) and all \\(B_i\\). We also can’t be certain taht the entire sample space is covered by \\(B_i\\) if tehy are not all disjoint (see problem 16 for implications). We can illustrate algebraically (to simplify we reduce some generality, but this argument does extend). Let \\[ n=2, \\ P(B_1\\cap B_2)&gt;0 \\] We can now let the \\(A\\cap (B_1\\cap B_2)\\neq\\emptyset\\), i.e. \\(A\\) also occurs in the intersection. We can now compute \\(P(A)\\):\n\\[\\begin{align*}\nP(A)&=P(A\\cap B_1)+P(A \\cap B_2)\\\\\n&=P(A\\cap((B_1\\cap B_2)\\cup(B_1\\cap B_2^c)))+P(A\\cap((B_1\\cap B_2)\\cup(B_1^c\\cap B_2))) \\\\\n&=P(A\\cap(B_1\\cap B_2)) + P(A\\cap(B_1\\cap B_2^c))+ P(A\\cap(B_1\\cap B_2)) + P(A\\cap(B_1^c\\cap B_2)) \\\\\n&=2P(A\\cap(B_1\\cap B_2))+ P(A\\cap(B_1\\cap B_2^c))+ P(A\\cap(B_1^c\\cap B_2))\n\\end{align*}\\]\nAs we can see here, we have to account for an area where \\(A\\) intersects twice, and as such, this effect will have us overestimate the probability of \\(A\\) occurring. As such the equation above is necessarily incorrect.\n\n\n\nProblem 16\nWe have an event, \\(A\\), and we are interested in figuring out the probability of it occurring. We know the probabilities of \\(B_1,...,B_n\\) and we know that all \\(B_i\\) are pairwise disjoint(\\(B_i\\cap B_j=\\emptyset, \\ i\\neq j, \\ \\forall i,j\\)). Why can’t we use the law of total probability here? What could go wrong? (It might help to draw a Venn diagram if you’re struggling.)\n\n\nShow solutions\n\nThe problem here is that the sum of all probabilities \\(P(B_i)\\) may not equal 1. If the sum of probabilities \\(P(B_i)\\) is less than 1, then there are cases where no events \\(B_i\\) occur. If \\(A\\) intersects here, the law of total probability will lead us to underestimating \\(P(A)\\), as there is no \\(B_i\\) that intersects this part of \\(A\\). Let’s try to show this algebraically (we reduce generality here too, but argument holds). \\[ P((B_1\\cup...\\cup B_n)^c)&gt;0, \\ (B_1\\cup...\\cup B_n)^c\\subset A, \\ n=2 \\] If we try to compute using the law of total probability we then get\n\\[ P(A)=P(A\\cap B_1)+P(A\\cap B_2) \\ (*)\\]\nNote that \\((E_1\\cup E_2)^c=E_1^c\\cap E_2^c\\)\nFrom this we know that \\(B_1^c \\cap B_2^c\\subset A\\).\nBecause they are disjoint we also know that \\(B_1\\subset B_2^c, \\ B_2\\subset B_1^c\\), but we obviously have \\(B_1, B_2\\not\\subset B_1^c \\cap B_2^c\\), as any event will be disjoint with its complement.\nThis tells us that we don’t account for \\(B_1^c \\cap B_2^c\\subset A\\) in \\((*)\\), and thus we must be underestimating the probability, and the equation cannot hold.\n\n\n\nProblem 17\nWe are considering the probability of an event, \\(A\\).

A test for the disease is 90% accurate for those who have the disease (i.e., it correctly identifies 90% of sick people) but also has a 5% false positive rate (i.e., it incorrectly identifies 5% of healthy people as having the disease).\nIf a randomly chosen person tests positive, what is the probability that they actually have the disease?\nFollowing, what would be the probability that someone testing positive is not sick?\nWould you consider this to be a good test?\n\n\nShow solution\n\nLet S be the event that a random person is suffering from the unnamed disease. Let T be the event that a random person gets a positive test. With this in mind, let’s try to identify what is given in the text.\n\\[ \\begin{align*}\nP(S)&=0.01 \\Rightarrow P(S^c)=0.99 \\\\\nP(T|S)&=0.90 \\\\\nP(T|S^c)&=0.05\n\\end{align*}\\]\nWe are now looking for then probability that a person who tests positive is sick. i.e. \\(P(S|T)\\).\n\\[\\begin{align*}\nP(S|T)&=\\frac{P(S\\cap T)}{P(S)}=\\frac{P(T|S)P(S)}{P(T)}\n\\end{align*}\\]\nWe already know the values of \\(P(T|S)\\) and \\(P(S)\\). Remains to find \\(P(T)\\).\nWe can attempt to use the law of total probability to find \\(P(T)\\).\n\\[\\begin{align*} P(T)&=P(T|S)P(S)+P(T|S^c)P(S^c)\\\\\n&=0.90*0.01+0.05*0.99\\\\\n&=0.009+0.0495=0.0585\\end{align*} \\]\nFinally; we can compute \\(P(S|T)\\)\n\\[P(S|T)=\\frac{0.90*0.01}{0.0585}\\approx0.154\\]\nLet’s now find the complement, i.e. \\(P(S^c|t)=1-P(S|T)\\).\n\\[P(S^c|T)\\approx1-0.154=0.846\\]\nThis should in no way be considered. When only 15% of cases report a true positive, that’s a bad sign. The false positive that constitutes about 85% of the positive tests is what we would call Type I errors. There is no one answer to what’s good level of Type I errors to have is when doing a test, but the most common benchmark is 5% (commonly denoted as \\(\\alpha=0.05\\), and is usually called the significance level of a test).\n\n\n\nProblem 31\nLet \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) be disjoint events.

Is this a probability distribution? Why or why not?\n\n\nShow solution\n\nThis is indeed a probability distribution. Here, each discrete possible value, is assigned a positive probability of occurring, and each of these probabilities add up to 1. Which are the requirements for a discrete probability distribution.\n\n\n\nProblem 33\nConsider now a fair dice with six faces.\n\nDo the results of a throw constitute a probability distribution?\nFind the expected value of the dice toss\nFind the variance of the dice toss\n\n\n\nShow solutions\n\n\nThis is indeed a probability distribution. Here, each discrete possible value, is assigned a positive probability of occurring, and each of these probabilities add up to 1. Which are the requirements for a discrete probability distribution.\nTo find the expected value of a randomly distributed variable we use the formula given by\n\n\\[ E[X]=\\sum_{i=1}^nx_ip(x_i) \\]\nHere, \\(X\\) denotes the random variable that has the distribution, \\(x_i\\) denotes the ith value \\(X\\) can take, and \\(p(x_i)\\) denotes the probability that \\(X\\) will take the value \\(x_i\\). Note that the sum of all \\(p(x_i)\\) should always add up to 1 exactly.\nFor a fair die with 6 faces we get possible values {1,2,3,4,5,6} and respective probabilities \\(p=\\frac{1}{6}\\) for each possible outcome. With this we can easily find the expected value.\n\\[ E[X]=\\sum_{i=1}^6x_ip(x_i)=\\sum_{i=1}^6x_i\\frac{1}{6}=\\frac{1}{6}(1+2+3+4+5+6)=\\frac{21}{6}=3.5 \\]\n\nWe have a general formula we can use to determine the variance in a distribution.\n\n\\[Var[X]=E[X^2]-(E[X])^2\\]\nFrom b) we already know \\(E[X]\\), and that can just be squared to find the second term in the equation, however, the first term \\(E[X^2]\\) still remains to be found. This term is found by squaring the values our random variable can take, i.e.\n\\[ E[X]=\\sum_{i=1}^nx_i^2p(x_i) \\] Let’s now compute this\n\\[ E[X]=\\sum_{i=1}^6x_i^2p(x_i)=\\sum_{i=1}^6x_i^2\\frac{1}{6}=\\frac{1}{6}(1+4+9+16+25+36)=\\frac{91}{6}\\approx15.167 \\]\nNow remember to finis the equation.\n\\[Var[X]=\\frac{91}{6}-(3.5)^2\\approx2.9167 \\]\n\n\n\nProblem 34\nA random variable, \\(X\\) has a binomial distribution if the three following requirements are fulfilled.\n\nThere are one or more draws which can end up in two states. Success or failure.\nFor each draw, there is the same probability for success.\nEach draw is mutually indpendent from all other draws.\n\nWe denote the total number of draws as \\(n\\), and the probability fro success on each draw as \\(p\\). For a binomial distribution we have special formulas for the expected value and variance.\n\\[ E[X]=np, \\ Var[X]=np(1-p) \\]\nFor a Binomial distribution, the probability distribution is given by\n\\[ P(X=x)=\\binom{n}{x}p^x(1-p)^{n-x} \\] Where x denotes the amount of successes drawn.\nA lightbulb manufacturing company claims that 95% of their lightbulbs pass quality control. A quality inspector randomly selects 20 lightbulbs from a day’s production line for testing. Let the amount of lightbulbs that pass quality control be given by the random variable, \\(X\\), and let \\(X\\) have a binomial distribution with \\(n=20\\) and \\(p=0.95\\).\n\nWhat is the probability that exactly 18 lightbulbs pass the quality check?\nWhat is the probability that at least 19 lightbulbs pass the quality check?\nWhat is the expected number of lightbulbs that pass the quality check?\nWhat is the variance and standard deviation (\\(\\text{SD}(X)\\)) of the number of passing lightbulbs?\n\n\n\nShow solutions\n\n\nTo find the probability that 18 bulbs pass the check we can simply plug our given information into the probability function. \\[\n\\begin{align*}\nP(X=18)&=\\binom{20}{18}0.95^{18}(1-0.95)^{20-18}\\\\&=\\frac{20!}{2!18!}0.95^{18}0.05^2\\\\&=\\frac{20*19}{2}0.95^{18}0.05^2\\\\&=\n190*0.95^{18}0.05^2\\approx1.887\n\\end{align*}\\]\nTo find the probability \\(P(X\\geq19)\\). Since we have only two cases where this is the case \\(P(X=19)\\) and \\(P(X=20)\\), as we only check 20 bulbs, this is a simple task. We need only compute these two seperate probabilities and sum them together.\n\nWe again make use pf the probability function.\n\\[ P(X=19)=\\binom{20}{19}0.95^{19}(1-0.95)^{20-19}=20*0.95^{19}*0.05\\approx0.377 \\]\n\\[ P(X=20)=\\binom{20}{20}0.95^{20}0.05^{0}=0.95^{20}\\approx0.358 \\]\nNow we need only sum these probabilities.\n\\[ P(X\\geq19)=P(X=19)+P(X=20)\\approx0.377+0.358=0.735 \\]\n\nThe expected number of lightbulubs that pass the quality check is given by the distinct fomrula\n\n\\[ E[X]=np=20*0.95=19 \\]\n\nThe variance is given by the formula\n\n\\[ Var[X]=np(1-p)=20*0.95*0.05=0.95 \\]\nThe standard deviation is always given as the postive square root of the variance.\n\\[\\text{SD}(X)=\\sqrt{Var[X]}=\\sqrt{0.95}\\approx0.975 \\]\n\n\n\nProblem 35\nA random variable, ( X ), has a Poisson distribution if the following conditions are fulfilled:\n\nEvents occur randomly and independently over time or space.\nThe events occur at a known average rate ( \\(\\lambda\\) ).\nTwo events cannot occur at exactly the same time.\n\nWe denote the average rate of occurrence by ( \\(\\lambda\\) ).\nFor a Poisson distribution we have the following formulas for the expected value and variance:\n\\[\nE[X] = \\lambda, \\quad Var[X] = \\lambda\n\\]\nFor a Poisson distribution, the probability distribution is given by:\n\\[\nP(X = x) = \\frac{e^{-\\lambda} \\lambda^x}{x!}\n\\]\nA call center receives an average of 3 customer calls per hour. Let the number of calls received in a given hour be modeled by the random variable ( X (10) ).\n\nWhat is the probability that exactly 2 calls are received in an hour?\nWhat is the probability that at less than 2 calls are received in an hour?\nWhat is the expected number of calls received per hour?\nWhat is the variance and standard deviation (( (X) )) of the number of calls per hour?\n\n\n\nShow solutions\n\n\nIn this case we can simply compute the probabilty with teh help of our distribution fuction. \\[\nP(X = 2) = \\frac{e^{-3} \\cdot 3^2}{2!} = \\frac{9e^{-3}}{2}  \\approx 0.224\n\\]\nHere we need to realise that less than 2 is the same as 0 or in this case. As such, we would like to compute both the probaility that none call in an hour and the probaility that exactly one call is received. Then finally we can sum these two proabilities.\n\n\\[ P(X=0)=\\frac{e^{-3}\\cdot3^0}{0!}=e^{-3}\\approx 0.050 \\] \\[ P(X=1)=\\frac{e^{-3}\\cdot3^1}{1!}=3e^{-3}\\approx0.149 \\]\n\\[\nP(X &lt; 2) = P(X=0)+P(X=1)\\approx0.050+0.149=0.199\n\\]\n\nFor a Poisson distribution the expected value is simply given by the parameter \\(\\lambda\\) which here represents average callers per hour. \\[\nE[X] = \\lambda = 3\n\\]\nFor a Poisson distribution in particular the variance and the expected value is the same \\[\nVar[X] = \\lambda = 3, \\quad \\text{SD}(X) = \\sqrt{3} \\approx 1.732\n\\]\n\n\n\n\nProblem 36\nA random variable, \\(X\\), has a geometric distribution if the three following requirements are fulfilled:\n\nEach trial results in either success or failure.\nThe probability of success is the same for every trial.\nEach trial is mutually independent from all other trials.\n\nThe geometric distribution models the number of trials up to and including the first success.\nWe denote the probability of success as \\(p\\). And thus it is very related to the binomial distribution. Whereas in the binomial we have decided upon a certain number of trials and then we check how many successes we’ve found, with a geometric we keep doing trials until we find a success, and then stop.\nFor a geometric distribution we have special formulas for the expected value and variance:\n\\[\nE[X] = \\frac{1}{p}, \\quad Var[X] = \\frac{1 - p}{p^2}\n\\]\nThe probability distribution is given by:\n\\[\nP(X = x) = (1 - p)^{x - 1}p\n\\]\nA machine produces small parts for watches.

    "text": "Exercises\n\nProblem 1\nYou are given the following data describing final grades in a tricky statistics course. There were 20 A’s, 97 B’s, 163 C’s, 76 D’s, 31 E’s and 13 F’s.\n\nWhat are the most and least common grades?\nOrganize this data in a frequency table\nFind the relative frequency of each grade\nWhat proportion of students failed the course?\nWhat proportion of students got a B or above?\nWhat proportion of students got between a C and an E?\n\n\n\nShow solutions\n\n\nThe most common grade is C with 163 instances, and the least common grade is F with only 13 instances.\nThe table can be organised like this for instance:\n\n\n\n\nGrade\nNumber\n\n\n\n\nA\n20\n\n\nB\n97\n\n\nC\n163\n\n\nD\n76\n\n\nE\n31\n\n\nF\n13\n\n\n\n\nBy summing the amount of respective registered grades we find that there are 400 total. We can now divide the number of instances for each grade by the total of 400 to find the relative frequency. For example, we have 20 instances of A’s out of 400 total grades.\n\n\\[\\frac{20}{400}=0.05\\]\nWe can repeat this for all grades and add to the existing table:\n\n\n\nGrade\nNumber\nFrequency\n\n\n\n\nA\n20\n0.05\n\n\nB\n97\n0.2425\n\n\nC\n163\n0.4075\n\n\nD\n76\n0.19\n\n\nE\n31\n0.0775\n\n\nF\n13\n0.0325\n\n\n\n\nThe only failing grade is F. We can read from the new table that this we have 0.0325 or 3.25% of students that failed this course.\nTo find out what proportion of students got a B or above we need the cumulative frequency. We find this cumulative frequency by summing thge relative frequency of all the relevant cases. In this case “B or above” is the same as achieving a B or an A. The relative frequency of B’s is 0.2425 and for A’s it’s 0.05.\n\n\\[ 0.2425+0.05=0.2925=29.25\\%\\]\n\nTo find out what proportion of students got grades between C and E we also need to find the cumulative frequency. Like in e this requires summing the appropriate relative frequencies. From the table in b we can see that the respective relative frequencies are 0.4075 for C, 0.19 for D and 0.0775 for E.\n\n\\[ 0.4075+0.19+0.0775=0.675=67.5\\%\\]\nAlternatively we can take note of the fact that we already know the proportion of students that were below this grade range (the proportion of F’s), as well as the proportion of students that scored above this range (the proportion that scored B or above). By subtracting the proportion of students that scored outside this range from 1 (100%), we should arrive at the same answer.\n\\[1-0.0325-0.2925=0.675=67.5\\%\\]\n\n\n\nProblem 2\nYou hear that the average starting salary after finishing a master’s degree at NHH is NOK 550 000, the median salary is NOK 525 000, and the mode is NOK 500 000. What can you infer from this?\n\n\nShow solutions\n\nThough they might seem similar on a surface level, the mode, median and mean give slightly different information.\nThe mode tells us what the most common observation in the data is. In our case this means that the most common starting salary after graduating with a master’s degree from NHH is NOK 500 000.\nThe median is the “middle value” in the dataset, meaning that 50 percent of the observations should be below this value, whilst the other 50 percent should be above this value. In our case it means that half of graduates will have a starting salary that’s NOK 525 000 or below whilst the other half get a starting salary of NOK 525 000 or above.\nFinally, the mean reflects the average of the dataset. We can tell here that the average is NOK 550 000. Additionally, by looking at everything in context we can also make some minor inferences. We see that the mean is higher than the median, indicating that some data points are skewing the average upwards, i.e. some graduates are earning really well compared to their peers from the get go. Additionally we see that the mode is 500 000, compared to the mean of 550 000. As the mode is the most common observation and is below the median, this seems to suggest that those who end up with a higher starting salary start with a substantially higher one compared to their peers, for the average to skew above the median.\n\n\n\nProblem 3\nAt a retail chain Floormart the Median pay by hour is $25, but the average is $33 per hour. What does this suggest?\n\n\nShow solutions\n\nSimilar to in Problem 2, the indication here seems to be that some employees may be earning significantly more than others. Exactly how many employees are earning more and by how much is impossible to tell given our available information, but it seems likely that the executives or managers and above may have significantly higher pay than most employees in Floormart. These few employees having a much higher pay than for instance new hires or other low level workers could explain this disparity.\n\n\n\nProblem 4\nIf possible, find the mode, median and mean of the following set of dice rolls\n\\[4,6,5,5,6,2,1,6,3,6,2,1,3\\]\n\n\nShow solutions\n\nThe mode is the most common observation. As 6 appears 4 times here, more than any other roll, 6 is the mode.\nTo clearly find the median we can sort the data from lowest to highest observation. We then end up with {1,1,2,2,3,3,4,5,5,6,6,6,6}. We have 13 observations here, so the median will be given by the 7th observation from the bottom. In our case we find that 4 is the median.\nFinally we can find the mean by taking the average of the observed rolls.\nRecall the formula for averages is\n\\[\\overline{X}=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}X_i\\]\nIn our case we can just sum each observation and divide by the number of observations, which is 13.\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n\\overline{X}&=\\frac{1}{13}(1+1+2+2+3+3+4+5+5+6+6+6+6)\\\\\n&=\\frac{50}{13}\\approx3.846\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\n\nProblem 5\nIf possible, find the mode, median and mean of the following set of favorite colors\nred,blue,blue,green,yellow,green,green,blue,red,red,pink,purple,blue\n\n\nShow solutions\n\nThe mode is found by finding the most common observation. Here “blue” is the most common favorite color, with 4 instances, and thus “blue” is our mode.\nIt is not possible to find a median within this data, as we need to be able to logically sort the data to be able to have a meaningful median. I.e. as the data is not ordinal, we can’t find a median.\nIt is not possible to find a mean from this data. We need numerical data to be able to give a meaningful mean.\n\n\n\nProblem 6\nWhat level of data is required to find modes, means, and medians? (Categorical, ordinal, etc.)\n\n\nShow solutions\n\nTo find a mode we need at least categorical data.\nTo find a median we need data that is ordinal.\nTo find a mean we need data that is numerical.\n\n\n\nProblem 7\nYou get the dataset \\[1,1,1,1,1,3,3,3,3,7,7,7,7,9,9,9.\\]\n\nFind the mode, median and mean of the above set.\nFind the the first and third quartile of the set.\nWhat are the 0th and 100th percentiles of the set?\nWould the median change if you were to add a single datapoint of 11 to the set? What would the median of the new set be? What if we were to add two datapoints of 11?\n\n\n\nShow solutions\n\n\nThe most common observation is 1, thus the mode is 1. We have an even number of observations in this set, 16.\n\nBy taking the average of the two middlemost values we will find the median. Both the 8th and 9th value in the set are 3, and thus the median of the set is 3.\nWe can find the mean by taking the average of the data.\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n\\overline{X}&=\\frac{1}{16}(1+1+1+1+1+3+3+3+3+7+7+7+7+9+9+9)\\\\\n&=\\frac{72}{16}=4.5\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\nThe first quartile indicates that 25% of observations should be below this threshold. In our case we see that the first quartile would fall between the 4th and 5th observation, which are both 1, telling us the 1st qaurtile is 1.\n\nThe 3rd quartile indicates that 75% of observations should be below it. The 12th and 13th observations are both 7, letting us know that the third quartile is 7.\n\nThe 0th percentile indicates the minimum value of the set while the 100th percentile indicates the maximum value. We can then say that the 0th percentile is 1 and the 100th percentile is 9.\nIf we add a datapoint of 11 to the set, we would now have 17 observations, meaning that the 9th observation from the bottom would indicate the median. The 9th observation from the bottom is 3, which is the same median as in the previous case, so the median would not change. If we were to add two datapoints of 11 to the set, we would have 18 observations. With 18 observations we have to take the average of the two middlemost observations after sorting. The two middlemost observations are the 9th and 10th ones from the bottom, meaning 3 and 7. The average would then be:\n\n\\[\\frac{1}{2}(3+7)=\\frac{10}{2}=5\\]\nThe median in this case would be 5, so it would indeed change from the previous case.\n\n\n\nProblem 8\nYou get this dataset of a group of 11 people and their respective heights in centimetres.\n\\[184,157,168,172,198,154,192,161,186,177,165.\\]\n\nFind the mean/average height of this group.\nFind the variance in height in this group and the standard deviation.\nDoes the variance and standard deviation seem big, small or somewhere in between in this context?\nWhat would be the effect on the variance of adding another person to the sample that is of the average height we found in a. Would the variance increase, decrease or stay the same?\nWhat would be the effect of adding another person to the group that’s 200cm tall. Would the variance increase, decrease or stay the same? Why is the change intuitive?\nWhat would be the effect of adding another person to the group that’s 140cm tall. Would the variance increase, decrease or stay the same? Why is the change intuitive? Why is the change in variance here greater than the one in e.?\n\n\n\nShow solutions\n\na)We sum our observations, and divide by 11, which is the number of observations.\n\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n\\overline{X}=\\frac{1}{11}(&184+157+168+172+198+154+192+161 \\\\ &+186+177+165)=\\frac{1914}{11}=174\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\nHere we need to first recall the formula for variance.\n\n\\[S_X^2=\\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(X_i-\\overline{X})^2\\]\nWe recall that the mean we found in a is 174 and that we have 11 total observations. Now we have everything we need to plug in our data and find the variance.\n\\[\\begin{align*}\nS_X^2&=\\frac{1}{11-1}\\bigg((184-174)^2+(157-174)^2+(168-174)^2 \\\\ &+(172-174)^2+(198-174)^2+(154-174)^2+(192-174)^2+(161-174)^2+ \\\\&(186-174)^2+(177-174)^2+(165-174)^2\\bigg)=\\frac{2132}{10}=213.2\n\\end{align*}\\]\nNow we only need to find standard deviation.Recall that the standard deviation is the square root of the variance.\n\\[S_X=\\sqrt{S_X^2}=\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(X_i-\\overline{X})^2}\\]\nIn our case we need only plug in the variance we have already found.\n\\[S_X=\\sqrt{213.2}\\approx14.6\\]\n\nVariance is hard to interpret directly, but the standard deviation is very simple. The standard deviation tells us that the average absolute difference from the mean in our data. Here we see that the standard deviation is 14.6cm, so on average the people in this group are 14.6 away from the the mean in terms of height. This means the we would expect a random person from this group to be either about 159cm tall or 188cm tall. It’s not all that simple to say if this is a lot or not, that depends on the data collected. If this is a sample from a group of Norwegian men age 20, this could seem like a very big standard deviation and variance. However, if this is a group of men and women with an age range from 14 to 35, this might not seem like such a big variance.\nIf we were to only add more people of the average height we found (174cm) the variance would decrease. There are two effects in play here. The when we add more observations our n gets bigger, and thus we divide by a larger number, but we also have to add another squared difference from the mean. In this case we add another observation that’s exactly equal to the mean. Firstly what effect will this have on the mean itself? Intuitively, the mean will not change in this case. Notice that the squared difference between the mean and itself is 0. \\[(\\overline{X}-\\overline{X})^2=(174-174)^2=0^2=0.\\]\n\nLet’s now add this to our equation for variance. Since we have one more observation we will be dividing by (n-1)+1=n, instead of n-1.\n\\[\\begin{align*}\nS_{X1}^2&=\\frac{1}{n} \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n(X_i-\\overline{X})^2+(\\overline{X}-\\overline{X})^2\\right)\n    =\\frac{1}{n} \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n(X_i-\\overline{X})^2+0\\right)\n    \\\\&=\\frac{1}{n} \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n(X_i-\\overline{X})^2\\right)\n    &lt;\\frac{1}{n-1} \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n(X_i-\\overline{X})^2\\right)=S_X^2\n\\end{align*}\\]\nFor those that don’t find it intuitive that the mean stays the same when you add more observations the equal the mean:\nUnderneath I have shown algebraically what happens to the mean when you add one more observation in the sample that equals the mean. This can easily be extended to adding any number, m, more observations (try for yourself!).\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n\\overline{X}_1&=\\frac{1}{n+1} \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{n}X_i+\\overline{X} \\right)=\\frac{1}{n+1}\\left( \\frac{n}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^nX_i+\\overline{X} \\right) \\\\ &=\\frac{1}{n+1}\\left(n\\overline{X}+\\overline{X}\\right) = \\frac{n+1}{n+1}\\overline{X}=\\overline{X}\n\\end{align*}\\]\nNow, let’s see what happens to the variance, when we add another observation that equals the mean.\n\\[S_{X1}^2= \\frac{1}{n-1+1}\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n(X_i-\\overline{X})^2+(\\overline{X}-\\overline{X})^2\\right)\\]\n\nWe can amend our data by adding the new observation of 200cm, and with this we can compute the new mean and variance. We will notice that since we add an observation that is higher than the average, the mean will increase, and we will also find that the variance (and consequently the standard deviation) will both increase. The new values will be:\n\n\\[ \\overline{X}\\approx176.17 \\\\ S_X^2\\approx250.15\\]\nThe intuition is simply that since our new observation is very different from our mean, the variance will increase. Adding the new squared difference has a greater effect than dividing by a higher number. Recall that our original mean was 174 and our original standard deviation was approximately 14.6. This means that the average absolute difference between an observation and the mean is about 14.6.\n\\[|200-174|=26&gt;14.6\\]\nThis means that by adding this new observation, since it’s difference from the mean is so clearly much greater than the standard deviation, the standard deviation should increase by adding this observation. When the standard deviation increases, so will the variance. (Note that we can only intuit in this way when the absolute difference between the new observation and the mean is quite a bit greater than the standard deviation. The intuition you should build from this is that new observations that are very different from the mean will increase the variance, and consequently, observations that are close to the mean will decrease the variance.)\n\nThis case is very similar to the one in e. The only notable difference is that we add an observation that is much lower than the mean, rather than one which is much higher. Computing the the new mean and variance we get:\n\n\\[\\overline{X}\\approx171.17 \\\\ S_X^2\\approx290.15 \\]\nThe intuition here is exactly the same as in e. Since the new observation is very different from the mean, the variance should increase. Let’s compare the absolute difference between the mean and the new observation to the standard deviation.\n\\[|140-174|=|-34|=34&gt;14.6\\]\nFrom this it should also be clear why the change in variance here is greater than the one in e. Since 140 is an observation that is farther away from the mean (174), than 200, the increase in variance will be greater.\n(Extra challenge for those that can’t get enough: Can you intuit what would happen in an opposite case? Would the variance change more if we added a new observation of someone that was 177cm tall or with someone that was 172cm tall?)\n\n\n\nProblem 9.\nRecall the variance and standard deviation found in Problem 8b. Imagine that instead of the height of people, the variance and standard deviation was instead found from data on height of trees (Note: the collected data is not necessarily the same even though the variance is the same). Does the variance and standard deviation feel big, small or somewhere in between in this context?\n\n\nShow solutions\n\nThis problem is mainly about interpretation, but let’s consider the standard deviation. We have a standard deviation of 14.6cm. A height difference of 14.6cm between two people is quite large, and very noticeable. When it comes to trees, however, that is not necessarily the case. Short trees can be as short as just a few centimeters, where as the tallest trees can reach upwards of 100 meters(!). Even without considering the shortest and tallest trees, we find that there can easily be several meters of difference between completely ordinary trees. Since we only know that we are working with trees in this case, it’s hard to assume anything about the data, but looking at the standard deviation we can tell that these trees must be very similar in stature as far as trees are considered. If anything, this variance, that seems quite reasonable (or even very large), when we consider the heights of people, seems completely minuscule when we consider trees instead. It’s impossible to say whether variance and standard deviation is large or small with no context, as is illustrated with this comparison.\n\n\n\nProblem 10\nIn what scenario would we get a Variance of 0?\n\n\nShow solutions\n\nFor the variance to be 0, our observations simply can’t vary. This means that all observations have to have the same value.\nThis can be shown algebraically. Let all observations \\(X_i=X\\) be equal. Then \\[\\overline{X}=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^nX_i=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^nX=\\frac{n}{n}X=X \\]\nIt is clear that all observations here are equal to the mean, which gives us.\n\\[\\begin{align*}\nS_X^2&=\\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum_{i=1}^n(X_i-\\overline{X})^2=\\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum_{i=1}^n(\\overline{X}-\\overline{X})^2 \\\\ &=\\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum_{i=1}^n0=\\frac{0}{n-1}=0\n\\end{align*}\\]\nBy looking at the equation for the variance, we can tell that if any one or more observations were to deviate from the mean, there would be variance in our data.\n\n\n\nProblem 11\nYou have a dataset with six observations and a mean of 50. Show that when you have any observations outside of the interval [45;55] the variance will always be greater than 5.\n\n\nShow solutions\n\nWe have received this information:\n\\[n=6, \\ \\overline{X}=50\\]\nTo show that that our variance will always be greater than 5 when we have an observation outside of the given interval, let’s consider the situation that would create the least variance. Consider a situation where only one observation is 55, and the rest of the observations have to make up for this by all of them being a bit less than 50. Since we use squared sums when we compute the variance, we would get the least variance from the 5 last observations being equally close to to the mean. We can use an equation to find out what each of these 5 observations have to equal. For this we use the formula to calculate an average.\n\\[\\overline{X}=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^nX_i\\]\nSince we know that the average we’re looking for is 50, one observation is 55 and the last 5 observations are equal, we get an equation with one variable.\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n50&=\\frac{1}{6}(5X+55) \\\\\n\\Rightarrow 6\\cdot 50&=5X+55 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow 300&=5X+55 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow 300-55&=5X \\\\\n\\Rightarrow 245&=5X \\\\\n\\Rightarrow X&=49\n\\end{align*}\\]\nNow we have a clear view of the data that would give the minimum variance. {49,49,49,49,49,55} Finally, we can compute the variance.\n\\[\\begin{align*}\nS_X^2&=\\frac{1}{6-1}\\left(5(49-50)^2+(55-50)^2 \\right) \\\\\n&=\\frac{1}{5}(5\\cdot(-1)^2+5^2)=\\frac{1}{5}(5+25) \\\\\n&=\\frac{30}{5}=6&gt;5\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\n\nProblem 12\nConsider the two following data sets, A and B. \\[A=\\{52, 49, 53,57,48,48,57,53\\}\\] and \\[B=\\{29,56,31,21, 79, 45, 51, 21\\}\\]\n\nFind the interquartile ranges of both A and B. Based on the ranges, which one seems to indicate a higher standard deviation?\nFind the variance and standard deviation of both data sets. Do the results fit with your guess from a).\nWhat intuition can interquartile ranges give when comparing variances? Can you always trust this intuition fully?\n\n\n\nShow solutions\n\n\nTo find the interquartile ranges we have to first find the quartiles in each data set, and to find the quartiles we need to order the sets as well. We now end up with\n\n\\[\\begin{align*}\nA=\\{48, 48, 49, 52, 53, 53, 57, 57\\} \\\\\nB=\\{21, 21, 29, 31, 45, 51, 56, 79\\}\n\\end{align*}\\]\nNow that both sets are ordered we can find the frst and third quartile in each of them by considering the 25th and 75th percentiles. In both sets the 25th percentile will fall between the second and third observations, whereas the 75th will fall between the 6th and 7th. Thus we take the average between these observations to fin the respective quatiles.\n\\[\\begin{align*}\nq_{1A}=\\frac{1}{2}(48+49)=48.5, \\ q_{3A}=\\frac{1}{2}(53+57)=55 \\\\\nq_{1B}=\\frac{1}{2}(21+29)=25, \\ q_{3B}=\\frac{1}{2}(51+56)=53.5\n\\end{align*}\\]\nFinally, we can find the interquartile ranges and compare them. Recall the formula for an interquartile range is given by the difference in quartiles.\n\\(IQR=q_3-q_1\\) Now, let’s compute the IQR for both A and B. \\[\\begin{align*}\nIQR_A=55-48.5=6.5 \\\\\nIQR_B=53.5-25=28.5\n\\end{align*}\\] Here we can see that the interquartile range for B is much larger than for A, which indicates a larger spread of data in B, which should give us a higher standard deviation.\n\nLet us compute the variances and standard deviations. By using the formulas familiar to us we will end up with.\n\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n\\overline{X}_A=52.125, \\ S^2_A\\approx13.27, \\ S_A\\approx3.64 \\\\\n\\overline{X}_B=41.625, \\ S^2_B\\approx403.70, \\ S_B\\approx20.09\n\\end{align*}\\] We can easily see that the indication from the IQR told us which data set had more variance.\n\nThe reason interquartile ranges can help give an indication of what data has more variance, is cause the interquartile range also gives an indication of how spread out the data is. The interquartile range tells us how far the 75th percentile is from the 25th percentile, i.e. a range for the middle 50% of the data. Keep in mind, however that a higher IQR does not necessarily mean a data set has a higher variance, even though it might seem that way at a first glance. When computing variance and standard deviation extreme values are very highly weighted even though they may not have any effect on the IQR.\n\nLet’s finish up by giving a quick example. We can amend A such that we change one of the data points that reads 57 to 1000 instead. We will call the amended set A’. We then get: \\[\\begin{align*}\nA=\\{48, 48, 49, 52, 53, 53, 57, 57\\}\\rightarrow A'=\\{48, 48, 49, 52, 53, 53, 57, 1000\\}\n\\end{align*}\\] Note here that the first and third quartile have not changed, and thus the IQR stays the same. However, when computing mean, variance and standard deviation we are going to see huge shifts.\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n\\overline{X}_{A'}=170, \\ S^2_{A'}=112482.86, \\ S_{A'}\\approx335.38\n\\end{align*}\\]\nThe 1000 observation is clearly an outlier here, but the point is that we always have to be careful when saying the IQR implies the variance, or anything similar. In many cases it may be true, but we should always consider the data we’re working with.\n\n\n\nProblem 13\nConsider the Boxplot below.\n\nWhich of the two groups has the higher median?\nWhich of the two groups seems to have the higher variance?\nWhich of the two groups has the higher IQR? Does this coincide with the one that has the higher variance?\nWould you think there are any outliers in the data? Why? Why not?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow solutions\n\n\nThe bold, black, horizontal line in each box represents the median for the data. We note that for group 1 the median is a little less than 15, and for group 2 it seems to be about 17. As such, group 2 has the higher median.\nWe note that the whiskers for group 2’s plot stretch out far wider than the ones for group 1. There are no points beyond the whiskers for either group, and as such we can conclude that group 2 probably has the higher variance. This coincides with the code used to generate the data.\nWe note that the box for group 2 is far taller than the one for group 1, which clearly shows that group 2 has a higher IQR. The lower line of the box indicates the the 1st quartile and the upper line gives the 3rd quartile. As such, the height of a box represents the IQR for the data used to generate the boxplot. This indeed coincides with the data we believe to have the higher variance.\nWe see no points beyond the whiskers of the boxes, and as such we treat none of the data as outliers. The whiskers here represent 1.5 times the IQR of the data, beyond either the 1st or 3rd quartiles. in many cases this covers all the whole range of data in a sample, however that is not always the case. In the below boxplot I have used the same data, however I added as single, clear outlier to group 1. This outlier is now the new maximum value and is indicated as a red dot. In general, when we consider outliers using boxplots, it’s most common to start by considering everything beyond the whiskers of the plot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProblem 14\nConsider the two viloinplots below.\n\nIn what ranges in each of the groups is data most dense?\nWhich group has the highest maximum, which one has the lowest minimum?\nIs it clear which group would have a higher median? Do you think this group also has a higher mean? Argue why or why not?\nWhat are some key differences to consider between a violin plot and a boxplot?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow solutions\n\n\nFrom a visually inspections it’s not 100% clear what the exact ranges are, but it does seem like for group 1 data is most dense in the intervals (12, 13), whereas for group 2 it’s around (13, 15). We see this as this is where the “violins” are the widest.\nA key aspect of violin plots is that they chow the distribution of the data in its entirety. This means that the top and bottom ends of the violins indicate the range of the data. Here it??s clear rthat group n2 has the higher maximum and group 1 has the lower minimum.\nThe median is the middle observation. Though we can’t see the exact point on a violin plot, we can see that the group 1 is comparatively “bottom-heavy” next to group 2, which indicates that the median should be higher in 2. We can also infer that the higher density of high numbers in group 2 indicate a higher mean as well. We can’t be 100% certain though, as we have no direct way of telling. (In an obvious case such as this though we can be at least 99% certain).\nThe key distinctions between violin and box plots are what attributes of the data they show. Whereas box plots show summary statistics such as the median, 1st and 3rd quartile and IQR, the violin plot shows how the data is distributed (i.e. the density of the data). As you should have noticed from the exdercises above, we can’t make many direct statements based on the violin plot, other than to draw semi-certain conclusions based on where we see the data is more and less dense. The boc plot also isolates ourtliers in a more clear way compared to the violin. Take a look at the below figure to see boc plots in the same data as the violins. Were the inferences from the above exercises correct?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProblem 15\nYou receive data about voting intention in a Norwegian community. Each bar represents the percentage of people in this community that wants to vote for a given party. Only people who intend to vote have been counted.\n\nWhich parties are most and least popular in this community?\nWhat is the approximate percentage point difference between the most and least popular parties?\nWhat problems could have been run into by using a pie chart instead of a bar plot?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercises about interpreting plots\n\n\nShow solutions\n\n\nIt clear that AP (Labour party) is the most popular and R (Red party) is the least popular in this community.\nAP has a voter turnout of about 20 percent wheres R has a turnout of about 5 percent. We thus get a difference of about 15 percentage points between the most and least popular parties.\nFor one, the pie chart would not clearly indicate the relative popularities of each party. It could for instance be very hard to tell which party was more popular between MDG and R, as they are very close in size here. Secondly, this pie chart would be very distracting top look at and hard to read, as you would not be able to read the information directly from the chart. Underneath there is an example. You could for instance add percentage labels to the chart below, but that would be visually much busier tha nthe bar plot as well as would work poorly when slices get very small.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProblem 16\nConsider the histogram below. The y-axis can be interpreted as percentages. The histogram shows the distributions of yearly salaries of a population in an area.\n\nWhat percentage of people in this population have salaries in the most common interval?\nWhat are key differences between histograms and bar plots.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow solutions\n\n\nThe tallest bin indicates the most common interval for salaries and it seems to include about 15 percent of the people in the population. The tallest bin seems to be somewhere between 600k and 700k NOK.\nIn a histogram each bin represents an interval of values, and any datapoint which falls within that interval will contribute to the height of that bin. A histogram will also necessarily represent the distribution of numerical sample data. A bar plot, however, represents the relative frequency of categorical data.\n\n\n\n\nProblem 17\nComment on the below scatterplot, focus on whether or not you believe the X and Y variables are dependent or not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow solutions\n\nIn this scatterplot there are no clear signs of correlation between X and Y. The closest thing one might get is that there seem to be fewer X and Y observations of more extreme values, however, that still doesn’t imply dependence. Each point seems randomly scattered out and there is no pattern to see here.\n\n\n\nProblem 18\nComment on the below scatterplot, focus on whether or not you believe the X and Y variables are dependent or not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow solutions\n\nHere there is a clear linear dependence between the X and Y variables. There correlation seems to be almost a perfect positive correlation of 1. This can very easily be illustrated by drawing a best fit line through the point. The image below illustrates the strong linear relationship.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProblem 19\nWhich of the following histograms are closer to a normal (Gaussian) distribution?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow solutions\n\nObviously 1 is far closer to a normal distribution than 2 is. We can clearly see that 1 is very close to the characteristic bell shape and a very symmetric distribution of points around the mean. Histogram 2 on the other hand is not at all symmetric around its mean and does not have the iconic shape, so it can easily be identified as non-normally distributed.\n\n\n\nProblem 20\nDetermine whether the below histograms display distributions that are right skewed, left skewed or neither.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow solutions\n\nHistogram number 1 is clearly extremely right skewed, which we can tell from the comparative length of the right tail and that the mass is concentrated on the left side of the plot. Number 2 is also very right skewed, but not quite to the extreme of 1.\nHistogram number 3 on the other hand is very left skewed, which should be obvious as its almost the complete opposite of the number 1.\nHistogram number 4 doesn’t seem to have any particular skewness, in actuality it seems remarkably symmetric.\n\n\n\nProblem 21\nConsider the 4 following histograms. Rank them from 1 to 4, where 1 indicates the “lightest tails” and 4 indicates “the heaviest tails”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow solutions\n\nThe correct ranking is 1-D, 2-A, 3-B, 4-C\nRecall that heavier tails implies that more mass will be farther away from the mean. Once one realises this fact it should be simple to order the histograms based on weights of tails. No points reach very far away from the mean of D, a few more for A, as one can tell by the longer interval on the x axis, even more are far away from the mean in B, and a very large amount in C.\n\n\n\nProblem 22\nRank these histograms created from normally (gaussian) distributed data in 3 different ways, from 1-6. In the first ranking, 1 should be the lowest mode and 6 should be the highest mode. In the second ranking do the same with the median and in the third with the mean. As there are a lot of data points in each of these histograms, you can treat them as perfect normal distributions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow solutions\n\nThe twist here is that since the data is all normally distributed the mode, mean and median is equal. I.e., if you’ve found one ranking you’ve found them all.\nThe correct ranking is 1-D, 2-F, 3-C, 4-B, 5-E, 6-A\nThe mode should be obvious in each one at it is indicated by the tallest bin. Furthermore, since all the histograms are so symmetric both the medians and mean should also be well within the middle bins as well. As such we end up with the same ranking in all three cases.\n\n\n\nProblem 23\nRank the following three histograms from lowest to highest variance. Consider the data in each case to eb normally distributed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow solutions\n\nThe correct ranking is\n1-B, 2-A, 3-C\nRecall that variance increases as spread of data increases. It’s clear that the data in B all fits within a pretty narrow interval, whereas the data in C needs a much larger interval to fit all of its observatrions. It’s not even entirely clear that we see all observations of C in the given interval. A seems relatively average, it at least does not stand out in any direction like B and C do.\n\n\n\nProblem 24\nFor this and the next problem you will need to recall how you compute means an variances.\n\\[ \\overline{X}=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum^{n}_{i=1}X_i, \\\nS^2_X=\\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum^n_{i=1}\\left(X_i-\\overline{X}\\right)^2\\]\nConsider the data \\[A=\\{a_1, a_2, ..., a_n\\}\\]. Now add 5 to every observation such that you get \\[A'=\\{(a_1+5),...,(a_n+5)\\}\\]. What would happen to the mean and the variance?\n\n\nShow solutions\n\nWe now have the situation\n\\[ A=\\{a_1,...,a_n\\}\\rightarrow A'=\\{(a_1+5),...,(a_n+5)\\} \\] Let’s the old and new means and variances have the following names.\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n\\overline{X}_{A} \\rightarrow \\overline{X}_{A'} \\\\\nS^2_{A} \\rightarrow S^2_{A'} \\end{align*}\\]\nWe will first consider what happens to the mean. Let’s try to compute the mean for \\(A'\\) \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\overline{X}_{A'}=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum^n_{i=1}(a_i+5)=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum^n_{i=1}5+\\sum^n_{i=1}a_i \\\\\n=\\frac{1}{n}5n+\\sum^n_{i=1}a_i=5+\\overline{X}_{A}=\\overline{X}_{A}+5 \\end{align*}\\] From this argument it should be clear that the 5 greater for \\(A'\\) than for \\(A\\), just like the case is for each of our observations.\nWe can now move on to considering what will happen to the variance. \\[\\begin{align*}\nS_{A'}=\\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum^n_{i=1}\\left((a_i+5)-\\overline{X}_{A'}\\right)^2\n=\\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum^n_{i=1}\\left((a_i+5)-(\\overline{X}_{A}+5)\\right)^2 \\\\\n=\\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum^n_{i=1}\\left(a_i+5-\\overline{X}_{A}-5\\right)^2 =\\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum^n_{i=1}\\left(a_i+5-\\overline{X}_{A}-5\\right)^2 \\\\\n=\\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum^n_{i=1}\\left(a_i-\\overline{X}_{A}\\right)^2\n=S_{A}^2\n\\end{align*}\\] Alas, the variance has not changed at all! The reasoning here is actually quite simple. All our observations may have increased by 5, but so has the mean. This means that the absolute difference between each individual point and the mean is the same for both data sets. So even though the data is different, it doesn’t vary any more or less in one case or the other.\nExtra challenge: There is only one key difference that would come to be if you were to subtract 5 to every datapoint instead of adding 5. What is that difference?\n\n\n\nProblem 25\nConsider the data \\(B=\\{b_1, b_2, ..., b_n\\}\\). Now double every observation such that you get \\(B'=\\{2b_1,...,2b_n\\}\\). What would happen to the mean and the variance?\n\n\nShow solutions\n\nWe now have the situation\n\\[ B=\\{b_1,...,b_n\\}\\rightarrow B'=\\{2b_1,...,2b_n\\} \\] Let’s the old and new means and variances have the following names.\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n\\overline{X}_{B} \\rightarrow \\overline{X}_{B'} \\\\\nS^2_{B} \\rightarrow S^2_{B'} \\end{align*}\\]\nWe will first consider what happens to the mean. Let’s try to compute the mean for \\(B'\\) \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\overline{X}_{B'}=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum^n_{i=1}2b_i=\n2\\frac{1}{n}\\sum^n_{i=1}b_i=2\\overline{X}_B \\end{align*}\\] It’s very clear that if every datapoint was to double, so would the mean.\nNow we compute the new variance. \\[\\begin{align*}\nS_{B'}=\\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum^n_{i=1}\\left(2b_i-\\overline{X}_{B'}\\right)^2\n=\\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum^n_{i=1}\\left(2b_i-2\\overline{X}_{B}\\right)^2 \\\\\n=\\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum^n_{i=1}\\left(2(b_i-\\overline{X}_B)\\right)^2 =\\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum^n_{i=1}2^2\\left(b_i-\\overline{X}_B\\right)^2 \\\\\n=\\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum^n_{i=1}4\\left(b_i-\\overline{X}_B\\right)^2\n=4\\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum^n_{i=1}\\left(b_i-\\overline{X}_B\\right)^2\n=4S_{B}^2\n\\end{align*}\\] So, by multiplying each datapoint by 2, we end up multiplying the variance by 4 (2 squared!!). This also makes surprisingly intuitive sense. When we double each datapoint, we are also going to double the distance between that point and the mean. When computing for the variance we find the squared difference between the data points and the mean, and thus, we end up multiplying our variance with 2 squared.\nExtra challenge: What would happen to the variance if we were to halve the value of each datapoint instead of doubling them?\n\n\n\nProblem 26\nConsider the data \\[C=\\{c_1, c_2, ..., c_n\\}\\]. Now consider what would happen if you were to amend the data by adding more and more of a single observation, \\(d\\) until you’ve added an endless amount of it. What would happen to the mode, median, 1st quartile, 3rd quartile, IQR, max, min, mean, variance and standard deviation? (Note: this exercise should be solved by reasoning rather than with rigorous mathematical arguments!!)\n\n\nShow solutions\n\nTo make every point clear, let’s go summary statistic by summary statistic.\nMode: The consequence on the mode is probably the most obvious one. Recall that the mode is the most common observation, i.e. the observation that occurs most often in the data. If the observation we are adding, \\(d\\), is not already the mode, then by adding an endless amount of it, and only it, at some point it will become the mode. It is inevitable that when we have limited data, adding an endless amount of a singular observartion will eventually result in it becoming the mode. Consider a quick example \\[C=\\{1,2,1,1,1,3\\}, \\ d=5\\] If we were to add \\(d=5\\) once or twice, the mode would still be 1. However, if we keep adding \\(d=5\\), then eventually 5 will become the mode. Once \\(d\\) has become the mode, the mode will not change if we keep adding to the data.\nMedian: The consequence on the median is similar to the one on the mode, in that eventually, the median will end up equaling \\(d\\). Eventually, by adding \\(d\\) more and more to the data, more than half of the observartions will be \\(d\\), and as such, no matter what \\(d\\) equals, it will be the median. Let’s consider the an example. \\[C=\\{1,1,1,1,2,3\\}\\] If we consider \\(d=5\\), as above, we see what by adding it once, it won’t be the median. However if we were to add it 10 times for instance such that we get, more than half of the data would consist of \\(d\\), which means that the middlemost values of the data would also have to be \\(d\\). (The exact same case would play out if \\(d\\) was a much higher maximum or the minimum value of the data). The cases where it would take the most for \\(d\\) to become the median are the ones where it’s either the maximum or the minimum, in all other cases it will take less for it to become the median.\n1st and 3rd quartile: The argument for the 1st and 3rd quartiles is exactly the same as for the median. The more iterations you add, the more of the data will be \\(d\\). After a while close to all data in would equal \\(d\\), and at that point it would also cover both the 1st and 3rd quartile.\nIQR: Recall that IQR is the difference between quartiles. From the argument above we know that at some point both the 1st and 3rd quartiles will be equal to \\(d\\), and at that point the IQR will obviously be 0. Depending on the data the IQR could increase for a bit at first, but after either the 1st or 3rd quartile becomes \\(d\\), it will start approaching 0.\nMin and max: The min and max will change only if \\(d\\) is either the minimum or maximum value in the set, and only if \\(d\\) is not part of the original data. However, if there are values that are larger and smaller than \\(d\\) in the original data, they will not change, no matter how many iterations we add. Consider for example: \\(C=\\{1,2,1,1,1,3\\}, \\ d=2\\) We would then end up with $ C’={1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,…,2,2,2,3}$ No matte how many times 2 is added, the max and min will not change.\nMean: In problem 8 we considered what would happen if we were to add a new observation with the same value as the mean, and we concluded there would be no change. So if \\(\\overline{X}_{C}=d\\), the mean would not change no matter how many times we were to iterate on the data by adding another observation, \\(d\\). Now consider what would happen if \\(d\\) is different from the. Let \\(m\\) be the number of observations in the original data, and \\(n\\) be the number we get when we add more observations. Computing the mean would then give us. \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\overline{X}_{C'}=\\frac{1}{n}\\left((n-m)d+\\sum^m_{i=1}c_i\\right)\n=\\frac{1}{n}\\left((n-m)d+m\\overline{X}_C\\right)\\\\\n=\\frac{n-m}{n}d+\\frac{m}{n}\\overline{X}_C\n\\end{align*}\\]\nNow we let \\(n\\) approach infinity.\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n\\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}\\overline{X}_{C'}\n=\\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}\\left(\\frac{n-m}{n}d+\\frac{m}{n}\\overline{X}_C\\right)\\\\\n=\\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}\\frac{n-m}{n}d+\\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}\\frac{m}{n}\\overline{X}_C\\\\\n=1*d+0*\\overline{X}_{C}=d\n\\end{align*}\\]\nThis essentially means, that after a while the mean will end up very close to \\(d\\), and it will keep approaching until it reaches \\(d\\). The nature of a limit like this means that it will end up infinitesimally close as long as we iterate a finite amount of data points, but the limit still holds true. Summed up, we can think that when a single observation makes up a vast vast majority of the data, other single observations will have basically no effect on the mean.\nVariance and standard deviation: In problem 8 we also concluded that the variance would decrease when adding more observations close or equal to the mean. Since we know the limit of the mean is \\(d\\) from above let’s argue based on that. When almost all of the data is centered around one point, and every other observation is negligible in comparison, they will contribute almost nothing until the variance reaches 0. Directly following from this, we get that the standard deviation will also approach 0, as it is the positive square root of the variance.\n(Note: the algebraic argument below is very abridged, it’s more to get the point across)\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n\\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}S_{C'}^2\n=\\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}\\frac{1}{n-1}\\left(\\sum_{i=m+1}^n(d-\\overline{X}_{C'})^2\n+\\sum^m_{i=1}(c_i-\\overline{X}_{C'})^2\\right) \\\\\n=\\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}\\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum_{i=m+1}^n(d-\\overline{X}_{C'})^2+\n\\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}\\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum^m_{i=1}(c_i-\\overline{X}_{C'})^2=\\cdots\n\\end{align*}\\]\nWe know that the first of these two sums will approach 0, as the difference between the mean and \\(d\\) will approach 0.

    "text": "Exercises\n\nProblem 1\nA university wants to study the average number of hours students sleep during finals week. They decide to gather data by surveying students.\n\nWhat is the population of this study?\nGive an example of a possible sample.\nWhy is it important to distinguish between a population and a sample?\n\n\n\nShow solutions\n\n\nThe population is all students at the university during finals week. Recall that tthe population is the whole group we want to study.\nA sample might be 150 students selected randomly from various departments. A sample cam really be **any* subset of the population, however, that does not mean that all samples are created equally. (This will be discussed more later)\nIt’s important to distinguish between a population and a sample because we usually cannot study the entire population. Instead, we use a sample to make inferences about the population. Understanding this distinction helps us evaluate the reliability and limitations of our conclusions.\n\n\n\n\nProblem 2\nA university wants to study the average number of hours students sleep during finals week. They decide to gather data by surveying students.\nSuppose the researcher only surveys students from the university’s Mathematics department. What potential issue arises from this sampling choice?\n\n\nShow solutions\n\nSurveying only Mathematics students would certainly introduce some degree of sampling bias. We can’t be certain that the sleep habits of students in the maths department would have similar habits to the average student. There could for instance be differences in workload and culture from one department to the next. Thus, we can’t safely generalise the findings, by looking only at the maths department.\n\n\nProblem 3\nSuppose a public health organization wants to estimate the average number of daily steps taken by adults in a large city.\n\nWhat are some key features the sample should have to be considered representative of the adult population.\nIn what way could one go about achieving a representative sample?\n\n\n\nShow solutions\n\n\nA representative sample needs to reflect the characteristics, proportions, and diversity of the of the entire population. I.e. there people of different ages, sexes and lifestyles should be proportionally (at least somewhat proportionally) represented in the sample, for it to be representative of the entire population.\nThe simplest way is to just select randomly from the entire population. Even though each pick is completely random, by the law of large numbers, once enough people are picked at random, the sample distribution should will approach the population’s. This isn’t always certain to work, as it mostly relies on having a sample of adequate size, as well asd needing to ensure that one is sampling form the entire population at random, and not a subset of it.\n\nOne useful method could be stratified sampling, where the population is divided into key subgroups (e.g., age groups, districts), and individuals are randomly selected from each subgroup. This ensures balanced representation across important variables.\n\n\n\nProblem 4\nLike in Problem 3, suppose a public health organization wants to estimate the average number of daily steps taken by adults in a large city. Suppose now also that some people choose not to respond. Could this possibly cause problems for the surveyors?\n\n\nShow solutions\n\nImagine if there was some significant distinction in attributes between the people that chose to reply, and of those who chose not to. I.e., those who reply and those who don’t aren’t necessarily random. This non-randomness in response could veyr well compromise the representative sample that we are looking for. Imagine that less active adults were less likely to respond than more active ones. In a scenario like this, the public health organisation might end up overestimating the average number of daily steps.\n\n\n\nProblem 5\nA new coffee shop wants to know what people think about their service. They post a feedback form on their website and collect responses for a week.\n\nIdentify one source of sampling bias in this method.\nPropose an alternative approach that would reduce sampling bias.\n\n\n\nShow solutions\n\n\nThe main bias comes from self-selection: only people who visit the website and feel strongly (either positively or negatively) are likely to respond. This could lead to results that do not reflect the general customer base.\nA better approach would be to randomly select customers in-store and ask them to complete a short survey, or to distribute surveys with receipts to all customers during the week, encouraging broad participation. This reduces self-selection bias and captures more typical opinions.\n\n\n\n\nProblem 6\nYou are conducting a study on the eating habits of university level students in Bergen. You want your results to generalize well to the full student population.\n\nSuggest a sampling method that would help ensure your sample is representative.\nWhat steps could you take to avoid overrepresenting certain types of students (e.g. from large universities or urban areas)?\nWhat issues could you run into if you only sampled students from NHH?\n\n\n\nShow solutions\n\n\nA good choice would be stratified random sampling. You could divide the college student population by school type (e.g., large universities, community colleges, private colleges), and then randomly select students from each group proportionally.\nTo avoid overrepresentation, ensure that each subgroup is sampled in proportion to its size in the overall student population. For example, if 30% of students are from smaller schools, then 30% of your sample should come from smaller schools too. You might also apply weighting to adjust for any imbalance in response rates after collecting the data.\nThough it may be more convenient for you to only sample NHH students, we are trying to consider the eating habits of the general student in Bergen. Looking only at NHH could very well lead to biased results, especially considering that NHH is far less diverse in field of study than institutions like UiB and HVL. a random sampling of all students, or a stratified sampling, would clearly lead to much more statistically rigorous results in a case liek this.\n\n\n\n\nProblem 7\nA news article reports: “80% of people in the city support the new policy,” based on a poll conducted by a political advocacy group on their own social media page.\n\nExplain why the results of this poll may be biased.\nSuggest a way to improve the sampling process to obtain more reliable public opinion data.\nSuppose a truly random sample of city residents shows only 45% support for the policy. How does this compare to the original poll, and what does it suggest?\n\n\n\nShow solutions\n\n\nThe sample is likely biased because it seems likely that very few non-followers of the party would respond to this survey, as the poll was conducted on their page. These followers may already share similar views, making them not representative of the broader city population.\nA better approach would be to conduct a randomized phone or email survey using a list of registered voters or residents. Alternatively, partnering with an independent polling organization that uses techniques like random digit dialing or address-based sampling could provide more reliable and representative data.\nThis suggests that the original 80% figure was inflated due to sampling bias. A truly random sample showing only 45% support reveals that the earlier poll was not representative of the general population. It highlights how non-random or biased sampling can lead to misleading conclusions.\n\n\n\n\nProblem 8\nSuppose you’re studying how the number of hours a student studies per week relates to their exam score. You propose the following relationship:\n\\[\n\\text{Exam Score} = 5 \\times \\text{Study Hours} + \\varepsilon\n\\]\n\nWhat is the deterministic part (non-random part) of this model?\nWhat does the error term \\(\\varepsilon\\) represent?\n\n\n\nShow solutions\n\n\nThe deterministic part is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Exam Score} = 5 \\times \\text{Study Hours}\n\\]\nThis is the part of the model that gives a fixed prediction based only on the number of study hours. I.e. the part of the model that is not randomly determined.\n\nThe error term \\(\\varepsilon\\) accounts for everything else that affects the exam score but isn’t included in the model — such as test anxiety, sleep, prior knowledge, or randomness. It reflects unexplained variation.\n\n\n\n\nProblem 9\nYou collect data on 5 students and fit a statistical model to predict exam scores from study hours. The model predicts:\n\\[\n\\hat{y}_i = 5 \\times x_i\n\\]\nwhere \\(x_i\\) is the number of hours student \\(i\\) studied. Karl studied for 6 hours, and his final score ended up being 35.\n\nWhat was Karl’s predicted score?\nWhat is the residual for Karl?\n\n\n\nShow solutions\n\n\nSince Karl studied for 6 hours we get that \\(x_i=6\\). Now we have everything we need to compute the predicted score. The predicted score is:\n\n\\[\n\\hat{y}_i = 5 \\times 6 = 30\n\\]\n\nThe residual is the difference between the predicted score and the actual score. Recall that the predicted score we found in a) was 30 and the actual score was 35. With this we can compute the residual. The residual is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Residual} = y_i - \\hat{y}_i = 35 - 30 = 5\n\\]\nThis means Karl did 5 points better than the model predicted.\n\n\n\nProblem 10\nA model assumes the error terms \\(\\varepsilon_1, \\varepsilon_2, \\dots, \\varepsilon_n\\) are identically distributed.\n\nWhat does it mean for the error terms to be identically distributed?\nWhy might this assumption be important when building a statistical model?\n\n\n\nShow solutions\n\n\nIdentically distributed means that each error term comes from the same probability distribution — e.g., all errors are normally distributed with the same mean and variance.\nThis assumption ensures that the variability is consistent across observations. If errors had different distributions (e.g. wider for some groups than others), then the model’s predictions could be unreliable or biased for certain parts of the data.\n\n\n\n\nProblem 11\nNow assume the model from problem 10 also requires the error terms \\(\\varepsilon_1, \\varepsilon_2, \\dots, \\varepsilon_n\\) to be independent. This means the error terms (residuals) are now independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.).\n\nWhat does it mean for error terms to be independent?\nProvide a situation where this assumption might be violated.\n\n\n\nShow solutions\n\n\nIndependent error terms mean that the value of one error term does not provide any information about another. The errors are not correlated and have no systematic pattern between them.\nA violation might occur in time series data (e.g. daily stock prices), where today’s error may be related to yesterday’s. Another example is when data points come from the same individual (e.g. repeated measures), introducing dependency between observations.\n\n\n\n\nProblem 12\nYou take a random sample of 50 students from a large university to estimate the average number of hours they sleep per night. The sample mean is 6.8 hours, while the true population mean (which you happen to know) is 7.1 hours.\n\nWhat is the sampling error in this situation?\nWhy does sampling error occur, even when using random sampling?\n\n\n\nShow solutions\n\n\nRecall that to find the sampling error we need ot subtract the population value \\(\\mu\\) form the sample value \\(\\overline{y}\\). We see here that he nsample mean is given by the average we find through our experiment \\(\\overline{y}=6.8\\) and the population value is also given \\(\\mu=7.1\\).\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sampling error} = \\overline{y} - \\mu = 6.8 - 7.1 = -0.3\n\\] I.e. our sample underestimated the true value by 0.3 hours, which is 18 minutes.\n\nSampling error occurs because we are only using a subset of the population, and that subset may not perfectly reflect the whole population due to natural variability. Even random samples will vary from sample to sample, producing different estimates.\n\n\n\n\nProblem 13\nSuppose you repeatedly take samples of size 30 from a population with a true mean of 50 and plot the means of those samples.\n\nWhat is this collection of sample means called?\nAs you increase the number of samples, what does the shape of this distribution tend to look like?\n\n\n\nShow solutions\n\n\nThe collection of sample means is called the sampling distribution of the sample mean.\nAccording to the Central Limit Theorem, the sampling distribution will tend to become approximately normal, even if the original population is not normally distributed — provided the sample size is large enough.\n\nHave a look at the figures below to see an example of how a sample distribution may look and develop as an experiment is repeated. Note how teh figures approach a bell curve.\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Set seed for reproducibility\nnp.random.seed(42)\n\n# Population: non-normal (exponential) to highlight the CLT\npopulation = np.random.exponential(scale=1.0, size=100000)\nn = 30  # Fixed sample size\n\n# Function to simulate means\ndef sample_means(num_samples):\n    return [np.mean(np.random.choice(population, n, replace=True)) for _ in range(num_samples)]\n\n# Simulate with increasing number of samples\nmeans_10 = sample_means(10)\nmeans_100 = sample_means(100)\nmeans_1000 = sample_means(1000)\n\n# Plot\nfig, axs = plt.subplots(1, 3, figsize=(15, 4))\ncolors = ['skyblue', 'orange', 'seagreen']\nsamples = [means_10, means_100, means_1000]\ntitles = [\"10 Samples\", \"100 Samples\", \"1000 Samples\"]\n\nfor ax, data, color, title in zip(axs, samples, colors, titles):\n    ax.hist(data, bins=10 if title == \"10 Samples\" else 20 if title == \"100 Samples\" else 30,\n            color=color, edgecolor='black')\n    ax.set_xlim(0, 3)\n    ax.set_title(title)\n    ax.set_xlabel(\"Sample Mean\")\n    ax.set_ylabel(\"Frequency\")\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProblem 14\nYou are estimating the average test score for a population. The population has a standard deviation of \\(\\sigma = 10\\).\n\nWhat is the standard deviation of the sample mean (also called the standard error) if you take a sample of size \\(n = 25\\)?\nWhat happens to the standard error if you increase the sample size to \\(n = 100\\)?\n\n\n\nShow solutions\n\n\nRecall that so find the standard deviation of the sample mean we use the formula \\[SD\\left(\\overline{Y}_n \\right)=\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} \\] Since we already know \\(n=25\\) and \\(\\sigma=10\\) we can easily compute the standard error. The standard error is given by:\n\n\\[\nSD\\left(\\overline{Y}_n \\right) = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} = \\frac{10}{\\sqrt{25}} = \\frac{10}{5} = 2\n\\]\n\nIf \\(n = 100\\):\n\n\\[\n\\text{SE} = \\frac{10}{\\sqrt{100}} = \\frac{10}{10} = 1\n\\]\nSo, increasing the sample size reduces the standard error, meaning the sample mean becomes more precise.\n\n\n\nProblem 15\nImagine you take 1,000 different random samples, each of size 40, from the same population. You compute the mean for each sample and plot a histogram.\n\nWhat does the center of the sampling distribution represent?\nHow does the spread of this histogram relate to sample size?\n\n\n\nShow solutions\n\n\nThe center of the sampling distribution represents the population mean (or it will at least be very close to the population mean). On average, the sample means will be centered around the true population mean.\nThe spread of the sampling distribution — measured by the standard error — decreases as the sample size increases. This means larger samples lead to less variability in the sample mean.I.e., we will see the the shape of the distribution close in on the population mean as the the sample size incereases.\n\nTake a look at the representation below to get an idea. The red line represents the population mean, and as the sample size increases the distribution of sample means becomes tighter around it, i.e. more observations are relatively close to the true population mean when n increases. This is the idea when we compute the standard error and notice that it decreases in n. this is also an effective illustration of the central limit theorem and the law of large numbers.\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Set seed for reproducibility\nnp.random.seed(123)\n\n# Skewed population: Exponential\npopulation = np.random.exponential(scale=1.0, size=100000)\nmu_true = np.mean(population)\n\n# Function to generate sampling distributions\ndef simulate_means_by_n(n, reps=1000):\n    sample_means = [np.mean(np.random.choice(population, n, replace=True)) for _ in range(reps)]\n    return pd.DataFrame({\n        'sample_mean': sample_means,\n        'sample_size': f'n = {n}'\n    })\n\n# Generate data\ndf = pd.concat([\n    simulate_means_by_n(5),\n    simulate_means_by_n(30),\n    simulate_means_by_n(100)\n])\n\n# Plot sampling distributions\nsns.set(style=\"whitegrid\", font_scale=1.2);\ng = sns.FacetGrid(df, col=\"sample_size\", sharey=False, height=4, aspect=1.2);\ng.map(sns.histplot, \"sample_mean\", kde=True, stat=\"density\", bins=30, color=\"lightblue\", edgecolor=\"white\");\n\n# Add vertical line for population mean\nfor ax in g.axes.flat:\n    ax.axvline(mu_true, color=\"red\", linestyle=\"--\", linewidth=1);\n\ng.set_axis_labels(\"Sample Mean\", \"Density\");\ng.fig.suptitle(\"Effect of Sample Size on the Sampling Distribution of the Mean\", y=1.05);\n\nplt.tight_layout();\nplt.show();\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProblem 16\nYou simulate the following experiment using software: (You don’t need to do this in Python yourself, but it could be a neat exercise to see it for yourself fully.)\n\nDraw 1,000 random samples of size \\(n = 30\\) from a population with mean \\(\\mu = 100\\) and standard deviation \\(\\sigma = 15\\).\nFor each sample, compute the sample mean and store it.\nPlot the histogram of all 1,000 sample means.\n\n\nWhat shape do you expect the histogram of sample means to have?\nApproximately where should the center of the histogram be?\nIf you were to repeat the experiment with a larger sample size \\(n = 100\\), what change would you expect in the spread of the histogram?\n\n\n\nShow solutions\n\n\nThe histogram should be approximately normal (bell-shaped) due to the Central Limit Theorem, even if the original population is not normal.\nThe center should be at or very near the population mean, which is \\(\\mu = 100\\).\nThe spread — measured by the standard error — would decrease. A larger sample size makes the sample means more concentrated around the population mean. Mathematically: (\\(SE\\) is an equivalent notation for the standard error)\n\n\\[\n\\text{SE}_{30} = \\frac{15}{\\sqrt{30}} \\approx 2.74, \\quad \\text{SE}_{100} = \\frac{15}{10} = 1.5\n\\]\n\n\n\nProblem 17\nA researcher wants to estimate the average amount of money undergraduate students at a large university spend on food per week. She:\n\nRandomly selects 40 students and records their weekly food spending.\nComputes the sample mean: \\(\\mu=\\$52.80\\).\nKnows from prior studies that the population standard deviation is approximately \\(\\sigma=\\$12\\).\n\n\n\nWhat is the sampling error if the actual population mean is $50?\nWhat is the standard error of the sample mean?\nExplain what would happen to the standard error if she used a sample of 160 students instead.\nIs this one sample mean likely to equal the population mean exactly? Why or why not?\n\n\n\nShow solutions\n\n\nWe have a sample mean \\(\\overline{y}=52.80\\), so then we should just subtract the population mean to compute the sampling error.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sampling error} = 52.80 - 50 = 2.80\n\\]\n\nWe can easily compute this as we already know the population standard deviation \\(\\sigma=12\\), and the sample size \\(n=40\\).\n\n\\[\n\\text{SE} = \\frac{12}{\\sqrt{40}} \\approx \\frac{12}{6.32} \\approx 1.90\n\\]\n\nIf \\(n = 160\\):\n\n\\[\n\\text{SE} = \\frac{12}{\\sqrt{160}} \\approx \\frac{12}{12.65} \\approx 0.95\n\\]\nSo the standard error would shrink, improving precision.\n\nIt is unlikely that the sample mean equals the population mean exactly. Due to sampling variability, different random samples will produce different estimates, though they should cluster around the true mean if the sample is representative. It will also be **likelier* that there is less of an absolute difference between the sample mean and population mean as the sample size increases, as this will reduce standard error. As illustrated in c), this effect improves precision.\n\n\n\n\nProblem 18\nYou’re given a population distribution with unknown form. However, you’re told the population has finite mean \\(\\mu\\) and variance \\(\\sigma^2\\). You draw a simple random sample of size \\(n\\), and compute the sample mean \\(\\overline{X}_n\\).\n\nAccording to the Central Limit Theorem (CLT), what is the asymptotic distribution of \\(\\overline{X}_n\\) as \\(n \\to \\infty\\)?\nWhat does the CLT not guarantee when \\(n\\) is small?\nIllustrate the two following results given the sample of size \\(n\\) given in this problem.\n\\[E\\left[\\overline{X}_n\\right]=\\mu\\]\n\n\n\n\\[ Var \\left[\\overline{X}_n \\right]=\\frac{\\sigma^2}{n} \\]\n\n\n\nShow solutions\n\n\nThe CLT tells us that a that a sequence of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) random variables \\(X_1,\\dots, X_n\\), with a an expected value \\(\\mu\\) and a finite variance \\(\\sigma^2\\) will have their average converge to a normal distribution, when \\(n\\) approaches infinity (\\(n\\rightarrow \\infty\\)). The average of these \\(n\\) variables we give as normal\n\n\\[\\overline{X}_n=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum^n_{i=1}X_i \\] The normal distribution is decided by two parameters; mean and variance. So to find exactly which distribution the CLT has \\(\\overline{X}_n\\) converge to we need the mean and variance. The rule from the lectures tells us that the mean of this normal distribution will remain the same as for \\(X_i\\), i.e. \\(\\mu\\) and that the variance will converge to \\(\\frac{\\sigma^2}{n}\\)\nIn short the CLT then says:\n\\[\n\\bar{X}_n \\xrightarrow{d} \\mathcal{N}\\left(\\mu, \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n}\\right)\n\\]\n\nWhen \\(n\\) is small, the sample mean may not be approximately normally distributed. The CLT is an asymptotic result, so the normal approximation improves with larger \\(n\\). If the population distribution is skewed or heavy-tailed, then the distribution of \\(\\overline{X}_n\\) is typically farther from the asymptotic normal distribution.\nThe first thing we need to do for both problems is to recall how we’ve defined \\[\\overline{X}_n\\]. By substituting and doing some algebra we will arrive at our desired results.\n\\[ E\\left[\\overline{X}_n\\right]=E\\left[\\frac{1}{n}\\sum^n_{i=1}X_i\\right] \\]\n\nFor expected values we are allowed to move constants such as \\(\\frac{1}{n}\\) outside of our brackets. We also know that the sum of an expectation is the expectation of teh sum, meaning that we can move the sum outside of our brackets as well.\n\\[ E\\left[\\frac{1}{n}\\sum^n_{i=1}X_i\\right]=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum^n_{i=1}E \\left[X_i \\right] \\] Now we can take advantage of all \\(X_i\\) being i.i.d., meaning they are identically distirbuted and will thus have the same mean, namely \\(\\mu\\).\n\\[ \\frac{1}{n}\\sum^n_{i=1}E \\left[X_i \\right]=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum^n_{i=1}\\mu=\\frac{n}{n}\\mu=\\mu\\] I.e.\n\\[E\\left[\\overline{X}_n\\right]=\\mu\\] ii) We essentially repeat the process here.\n\\[ Var \\left[\\overline{X}_n \\right] = Var \\left[\\frac{1}{n}\\sum^n_{i=1}X_i \\right] \\] For variances we are allowed to move constants such as \\(\\frac{1}{n}\\) outside of our brackets if we square them. I.e.\n\\[Var[aY]=a^2Var[Y] \\] (For those not entirely convinced by this, try to compute it bye using that \\(Var[Y]=E[Y^2]-(E[X])^2\\))\nWe also have that the sum of a variance is the variance of the sum as long as the random variables included in the sum are mutually independent of each other. In this case all our variables are i.i.d., meaning that the independence requirement is met; and thus we can move the sum outside of the brackets as well. We then get:\n\\[ Var \\left[\\frac{1}{n}\\sum^n_{i=1}X_i \\right] = \\frac{1}{n^2}\\sum^n_{i=1}Var[X_i] \\]\nAll of our \\(X_i\\) are identically distributed with the same variance; \\(\\sigma^2\\):\n\\[ \\frac{1}{n^2}\\sum^n_{i=1}Var[X_i] = \\frac{1}{n^2}\\sum^n_{i=1}\\sigma^2=\\frac{n}{n^2}\\sigma^2=\\frac{\\sigma^2}{n} \\] And we are done\n\\[ Var \\left[\\overline{X}_n \\right]=\\frac{\\sigma^2}{n} \\]\n\n\n\nProblem 19\nYou want to apply the Central Limit Theorem to a dataset of measurements collected from a machine. However, before proceeding, your colleague reminds you that “the CLT has assumptions!”\n\nList the assumptions required for the CLT to hold for sample means.\nSuppose the machine’s output is not independent from one sample to the next. Can you still apply the CLT?\n\n\n\nShow solutions\n\n\nThe main assumptions for the classical CLT are:\n\n\nThe data are independent\nThe data are identically distributed\nThe population has finite mean and finite variance\n\n\nIf the data are not independent (e.g., time-dependent or autocorrelated), then the classical CLT may not apply. There are generalized versions of the CLT for dependent data, but in this setting, using the standard version would lead to misleading conclusions about the sampling distribution.\n\n\n\n\nProblem 20\nYou simulate 10,000 observations from each of the following distributions:\n\nExponential(1)\nUniform(0, 1)\nBernoulli(0.2)\n\nFor each distribution, you compute the sample mean of many repeated samples of size \\(n = 50\\). What assumptions would you have to make in this case to be certain?\n\nFor each distribution above, is the CLT applicable? Why?\nWhat would you expect the distribution of the sample means to look like?\n\n\n\nShow solutions\n\n\nOur requirements to use CLT are:\n\n\nThe distributions have finite mean and variance\nWe have a random sample of fixed size\nThe samples are independent and identically distributed\n\nIn all cases we have that the distributions have finite means and variances. Since we’re simulating from the same distributions, we can be certain they are identical, but we still assume independence (using a random draw with Python for example this requirement is met). It’s also clear that we have random samples of a fixed size in this case as our simulation is takes the mean of assorted samples of 50.\n\nIn all three cases, the distribution of sample means should be approximately normal, centered at the true population mean, with smaller spread as \\(n\\) increases. The exponential is heavily skewed, so its sample mean distribution may look less normal than the others, but should still be roughly bell-shaped.\n\n\n\n\nProblem 21\nLet \\(X_1, \\dots, X_n\\) be i.i.d. random variables from a distribution with mean \\(\\mu = 3\\) and variance \\(\\sigma^2 = 4\\).

You are told that it is possible to generate a random variable \\(X\\) from another distribution by transforming \\(U\\). This technique is called inverse transform sampling.\nSuppose you want to generate random variables from an exponential distribution with parameter \\(\\lambda &gt; 0\\), which has CDF\n\\[\nF(x) = 1 - e^{-\\lambda x}, \\quad x \\ge 0\n\\]\n\nSolve for the inverse of the CDF, \\(F^{-1}(u)\\), where \\(u \\in (0,1)\\).\nLet \\(U \\sim \\text{Uniform}(0,1)\\). Show that if we define \\(X = F^{-1}(U)\\), then \\(X \\sim \\text{Exp}(\\lambda)\\).\nWhat general steps does this illustrate about how inverse transform sampling works?\n\n\n\nShow solutions\n\n\nStart with:\n\n\\[\nF(x) = 1 - e^{-\\lambda x}\n\\Rightarrow u = 1 - e^{-\\lambda x}\n\\Rightarrow e^{-\\lambda x} = 1 - u\n\\Rightarrow -\\lambda x = \\log(1 - u)\n\\Rightarrow x = -\\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\log(1 - u)\n\\]\nSince \\(1 - u \\sim \\text{Uniform}(0,1)\\) as well, we often write:\n\\[\nF^{-1}(u) = -\\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\log u\n\\]\n\nLet \\(U \\sim \\text{Uniform}(0,1)\\) and define \\(X = -\\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\log U\\). We want to show that \\(X \\sim \\text{Exp}(\\lambda)\\). Compute the CDF:\n\n\\[\nP(X \\le x) = P\\left(-\\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\log U \\le x\\right) = P\\left(\\log U \\ge -\\lambda x\\right)\n= P\\left(U \\ge e^{-\\lambda x}\\right)\n= 1 - P(U &lt; e^{-\\lambda x}) = 1 - e^{-\\lambda x}\n\\] For the last step you must recall the CDF of a uniform distribution.\\[U\\sim \\text{Uniform(a,b)}\\]. In our case we have \\(a=0\\) and \\(b=1\\).\n\\[F_U(u)=P(U\\leq u)=\\frac{u}{b-a}=\\frac{u}{1}=u\\]\nSo the CDF of \\(X\\) matches the exponential distribution. Hence, \\(X \\sim \\text{Exp}(\\lambda)\\).\n\nThe inverse transform sampling procedure works as follows:\n\n\n\nStart with a known distribution with invertible CDF, \\(F\\)\nSample \\(U \\sim \\text{Uniform}(0,1)\\)\nSet \\(X = F^{-1}(U)\\)\n\nThen \\(X\\) has the distribution defined by \\(F\\). This method is particularly useful when direct sampling is hard, but the inverse CDF is known or easy to compute.\n\n\n\nProblem 31\nIn this exercise, you will implement inverse transform sampling to generate samples from an exponential distribution with rate \\(\\lambda = 2\\), and compare the result to samples generated by R’s built-in exponential sampler. (Feel free to use Python or any other language to do the same)\n\nUse the inverse CDF method to generate 10,000 samples from an \\(\\text{Exp}(\\lambda = 2)\\) distribution in R. Recall the inverse CDF is\n\n\\[\nX = -\\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\log(U)\n\\]\n\nUse R’s built-in function rexp(n, rate = 2) to generate another 10,000 samples from the same distribution.\nCreate a histogram of both sample sets on the same scale. Overlay the theoretical exponential density curve for comparison.\nComment on the similarity between the two sample sets and the theoretical distribution.

This illustrates that inverse transform sampling correctly reproduces the distribution, even when sampling is done indirectly via uniform draws.\n\n\n\n\nProblem 32\nMonte Carlo simulation is a technique used to approximate mathematical quantities through repeated random sampling.\n\nWhat is the purpose of Monte Carlo simulation in statistics and data analysis?\nHow does the Law of Large Numbers justify the use of Monte Carlo methods?\n\n\n\nShow solutions\n\n\nMonte Carlo simulation is used to estimate expectations, probabilities, or other quantities that are hard (or impossible) to compute analytically. By simulating many random samples and averaging the results, we approximate the desired value.\nThe Law of Large Numbers states that the sample average converges to the expected value as the number of samples increases. In Monte Carlo methods, this justifies approximating:\n\n\\[\nE[f(X)] \\approx \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n f(X_i)\n\\]\nwhere \\(X_i \\sim \\text{Distribution of } X\\).\n\n\n\nProblem 33\nLet \\(X \\sim \\text{Uniform}(0, 1)\\). You are interested in estimating \\(E[X^2]\\) using Monte Carlo simulation.\n\nGenerate three values: \\(X_1 = 0.2, X_2 = 0.6, X_3 = 0.9\\).

Exact value:\n\\[\nE[X^2] = \\int_0^1 x^2 dx =\\frac{1}{3}\\left[x^3\\right]^1_0= \\frac{1}{3} \\approx 0.333\n\\]\nThe estimate \\(0.403\\) is fairly close given the very small sample size.\n\n\n\nProblem 34\nYou want to estimate the area under the curve \\(y = \\sqrt{1 - x^2}\\) for \\(x \\in [0,1]\\), which corresponds to a quarter of a unit circle. This will allow you to approximate \\(\\pi\\).\n\nExplain how you can estimate this area using Monte Carlo simulation.\nWithout using a computer, simulate with the following 5 random pairs:\n\n\\[\n(x, y) \\in \\{ (0.1, 0.5), (0.4, 0.2), (0.6, 0.9), (0.3, 0.7), (0.9, 0.1) \\}\n\\]\nUse these to estimate the area.\n\nWhat is the true area? How good is the estimate?\n\n\n\nShow solutions\n\n\nWe sample points \\((x, y)\\) uniformly in the unit square \\([0,1] \\times [0,1]\\), and count how many fall below the curve. The proportion of points under the curve estimates the area.\nWe check whether each point satisfies \\(y \\le \\sqrt{1 - x^2}\\), as only those will fall withing the quarter of the unit circle:\n\n\n\\((0.1, 0.5)\\): \\(\\sqrt{1 - 0.01} = \\sqrt{0.99} \\approx 0.995 &gt; 0.5\\): ✅\n\\((0.4, 0.2)\\): \\(\\sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \\sqrt{0.84} \\approx 0.916 &gt; 0.2\\): ✅\n\\((0.6, 0.9)\\): \\(\\sqrt{1 - 0.36} = \\sqrt{0.64} = 0.8 &lt; 0.9\\): ❌\n\\((0.3, 0.7)\\): \\(\\sqrt{1 - 0.09} = \\sqrt{0.91} \\approx 0.954 &gt; 0.7\\): ✅\n\\((0.9, 0.1)\\): \\(\\sqrt{1 - 0.81} = \\sqrt{0.19} \\approx 0.436 &gt; 0.1\\): ✅\n\nSo, 4 out of 5 points were below the curve:\n\\[\n\\text{Estimated area} = \\frac{4}{5} = 0.8\n\\] We know the area of the unit circle is \\(\\pi\\), so the quarter we’ve estimated now should be a fourth of \\(\\pi\\). As such we get:\n\\[\\text{Estimated } \\pi = 4 \\times 0.8 = 3.2\\]\n\nThe true area is \\(\\frac{\\pi}{4} \\Rightarrow \\pi \\approx 3.14\\).

The test statistic follows a t-distribution with degrees of freedom (df): \\[\\text{df}=\\frac{\\big(\\frac{s_1^2}{n_1}+\\frac{s_2^2}{n_2}\\big)^2}{\\frac{(s_1^2/n_1)^2}{n_1-1}+\\frac{(s_1^2/n_2)^2}{n_2-1}}\\]\n\n\nAn e-commerce company wants to test whether showing customer reviews on product pages increases the average number of purchases. Behavioral economics suggests that social proof (i.e., seeing others’ positive experiences) influences decision-making and can lead to higher sales.\nTo test this, the company randomly selected two groups of products: one group displayed customer reviews, and the other did not. They then compared the average daily sales per product between the two groups.\n\nSet up the null- and alternative hypothesis. Use 10% significance level.\nDiscuss how the test statistic will behave under the various hypothesis.\n\nThe experiment result in the following data:\n\nProducts with reviews: Sample mean daily sales = 120 units, Sample standard deviation = 30, Sample size = 40\nProducts without reviews: Sample mean daily sales = 105 units, Sample standard deviation = 28, Sample size = 40\n\n\nCalculate the test statistic and the degrees of freedom.\nFind the p-value.

This increase in completed orders increases the volume, but the free shipping will reduce the margin on each order. We would need more information to assess whether this specific experiment that resulted in a statistically significant increase in volume, also resulted in a economically significant increase of profits.\n\n\n\n\n\nA company is testing whether a new website layout increases the proportion of users who complete a purchase.

The rule gives an approximate measure of what proportion of the data that lies within a certain range of the mean.\n\n\n~68% of data lie within 1σ of the mean\n~95% within 2σ\n~99.7% within 3σ\n\nThis helps assess spread and typicality.\n\n\n\n\nGiven that \\(X \\sim \\mathcal{N}(100, 15^2)\\) (i.e. \\(X\\) is normally distributed with mean \\(\\mu=100\\) and standard deviation \\(\\sigma=15\\)), calculate:\n\nThe probability of \\(X &lt; 100\\). Why do we not need to consider the standard deviation when calculating this?\nThe approximate probability that \\(X &lt; 115\\)\nUse a z-transformation to b) to standard normal, and compute using a calculator. Let \\(Z\\sim \\matchal{N}(0,1)\\), we call that a standard normal distribution. We also have that\n\n\\[\nZ=\\frac{X-\\mu}{\\sigma}\n\\]\n\n\nShow solution\n\n\nWe know that the normal distribution is symmetric around the mean, i.e. we have a 50-50 chance of finding an \\(X\\) above or below the mean. The mean here is 100, and was such we get\n\n\\[\nP(X&gt;100)=\\frac{1}{2}=0.5\n\\]\n\nWe can use the 68-95-99.7 rule to find the approximate probability. 115 is one standard deviation greater than the mean. That means we have to account for half of the 68% from the rule. I.e.\n\n\\[\nP(X\\in(100,115))=\\frac{0.68}{2}\\approx0.34\n\\] Now let’s also account for the cases where \\(X\\leq 100\\)\n\\[\nP(X&lt;115)=P(X\\leq100)+P(X\\in(100,115))\\approx0.5+0.34=0.84\n\\] Note: Since the normal distribution is continuous \\(P(X&lt;x)=P(X\\leq x)\\)\n\n\\[\nP(X&lt;115)=P\\left(\\frac{Z-100}{15}&lt;\\frac{115-100}{15}\\right)=P(Z&lt;1)=0.8413\n\\]\n\nInterpretation: There’s about an 84.13% chance that \\(X\\) will be below 115, which is equivalent to \\(Z\\) being below 1.\n\n\n\n\nSuppose a random variable \\(X \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma^2)\\). Show that:\n\\[\nP(a &lt; X &lt; b) = P\\left( \\frac{a - \\mu}{\\sigma} &lt; Z &lt; \\frac{b - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\right)\n\\]\n\n\nShow solution\n\nThis transformation uses the standardization:\n\\[\nZ = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma}\n\\]\nBy applying this, we shift any normal distribution to the standard normal. We need only substitute and solve like a regular inequality, and the equivalence becomes clear.\n\\[\nP(a &lt; X &lt; b) = P\\left( \\frac{a - \\mu}{\\sigma} &lt; Z &lt; \\frac{b - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\right)\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the symmetry of the standard normal distribution to explain why:\n\n\\[\nP(Z &gt; 1.96) = P(Z &lt; -1.96)\n\\]\n\nCalculate \\(P(|Z| &gt; 1.96)\\)\n\n\n\nShow solution\n\n\nThe standard normal is symmetric about 0, so:\n\n\\[\nP(Z &gt; c) = P(Z &lt; -c)\n\\] This equality comes from the logical fact of us a random varabiable being just as unlikely to take a value beyond a certain distance from the mean, no matter if the distance is in a positive of a negative directoion.\n\n\n\n\\[\nP(|Z| &gt; 1.96) =P(Z&lt;-1.96))+P(Z&gt;1.96)=2P(Z&lt;-1.96)\\approx 2*0.025=0.05\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nSketch or describe how the t-distribution changes as degrees of freedom increase.\nWhat does the t-distribution converge to?\n\n\n\nShow solution\n\n\nWith low degrees of freedom, the t-distribution is flatter and has fatter tails. As df increases, it becomes more peaked. The t-distribution also always has a mean of 0, and is symmetric around 0.\nAs df → ∞, the t-distribution approaches the standard normal distribution.\n\nWe can illustrate this quite simply without going into the ideas fully.\nLet first \\(X_1,\\dots,X_n\\sim i.i.d. \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma^2)\\), and then let\n$$ {X}=^n_{i=1}X_i, S2=_{i=1}(X_i-{X})^2\n\\[\nIt can then be shown that\n\\] (0,1), t_{n-1} $$ Where \\(t_{n-1}\\) indicates a t-distribution with \\(df=n-1\\).

The rule gives an approximate measure of what proportion of the data that lies within a certain range of the mean.\n\n\n~68% of data lie within 1σ of the mean\n~95% within 2σ\n~99.7% within 3σ\n\nThis helps assess spread and typicality.\n\n\n\n\nGiven that \\(X \\sim \\mathcal{N}(100, 15^2)\\) (i.e. \\(X\\) is normally distributed with mean \\(\\mu=100\\) and standard deviation \\(\\sigma=15\\)), calculate:\n\nThe probability of \\(X &lt; 100\\).

The mean here is 100, and was such we get\n\n\\[\nP(X&gt;100)=\\frac{1}{2}=0.5\n\\]\n\nWe can use the 68-95-99.7 rule to find the approximate probability. 115 is one standard deviation greater than the mean. That means we have to account for half of the 68% from the rule. I.e.\n\n\\[\nP(X\\in(100,115))=\\frac{0.68}{2}\\approx0.34\n\\] Now let’s also account for the cases where \\(X\\leq 100\\)\n\\[\nP(X&lt;115)=P(X\\leq100)+P(X\\in(100,115))\\approx0.5+0.34=0.84\n\\] Note: Since the normal distribution is continuous \\(P(X&lt;x)=P(X\\leq x)\\)\n\n\\[\nP(X&lt;115)=P\\left(\\frac{Z-100}{15}&lt;\\frac{115-100}{15}\\right)=P(Z&lt;1)=0.8413\n\\]\n\nInterpretation: There’s about an 84.13% chance that \\(X\\) will be below 115, which is equivalent to \\(Z\\) being below 1.\n\n\n\n\nSuppose a random variable \\(X \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma^2)\\).

    "text": "Case 1\n\n\n\nPoster by Hege Landsvik ©\n\n\nSource: Landsvik, H., Martuza, J., Skard, S., Pedersen, L. J. T., & Jørgensen, S. Group Identity and Pro-Environmental Behavior in Public Settings: Using Identity-based Nudges to Enhance Recycling in the Field. Preprint.\nIn this case session, you will be making a descriptive analysis of a dataset from a field experiment on Brann Stadium, the home of Bergen’s local soccer team.\nThe researchers gathered data on the number of cups sold on the away stand at Brann Stadium. After each match, they went through the garbage, at counted how many cups was correctly recycled, that is, put in the bin for soda- and coffee cups. The experiment was constructed using two treatments. Firstly, they used a nudge, by putting a sign over the bins asking “Who is the most environmental away supporters in Eliteserien (Norway’s highest soccer league)?” Sort you garbage here.” The sign would also have the logo of the away team. This is called an ingroup appeal. The other treatment is gamification. Here they would set up a table showing the sorting rate of the other away teams. The intent of the researchers is to make it a sorting competition against the other teams.\nThe dataset has the following variables:\n\nMatch_Number: Match ID. Starting from the second home match of the 2023 season.\nOpponent: Name of the away team - adjusted for æøå.\nAway_Conditon: Baseline, Ingroup or Outgroup\nGamification_Days: Baseline, No, Yes.\nWinner: Who won the match? Home, tie or Away.\nSortedCup: Was the cup sorted? 0: No, 1: Yes.\n\nEach observation is a cup sold. If the cup was put in the correct bin, sortedCup column is 1, otherwise it is zero.\n\nCreate a frequency table for each match counting how many cups was sold and how many was correctly sorted. Which away team supporters are the largest consumers of coffee?\nAdd a relative frequency (sorting rate) column to your table. What team is the best recyclers?\nSummarize the sorting rates across teams and treatments, using mean, median, standard deviation, 1st and 3rd quartile.\nCreate a good visualization of the sorting rate for the various teams.\nNow, the different teams were exposed to different treatments, both for the in- or out-group message on the banner and whether they were exposed to gamification or not. If we disregard the individual teams and only consider these treatments marginally (marginally means one treatment at a time).\n\n\nUse suitable summary statistics to summarize the effect of different treatments.\nMake suitable figures to visualize the effects. One suggestion: Use boxplots.\n\nDiscuss your summary statistics and visuals within the group."
