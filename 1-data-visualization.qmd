## Controll questions

-   Why should you always show the data?
-   What does it mean to maximize the data/ink ratio?
-   You may think that bar plots in 3D looks cool. Why should we not use that?
-   What is distorting the data?
-   If you want to compared Gross Domestic Product (GDP) between the US and Norway, how should you adjust the data?
-   What does it mean to be "kind to the colorblind"?
-   Why should you never use a pie chart? Ever.
-   What would be a good alternative to a pie chart?
