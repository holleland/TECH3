## Control questions

1. What is the decision rule in hypothesis testing?
2. What is a Type I error?
3. What is the interpretation of the significance level in the Neyman-Pearson framework?
4. In what types of situations is this interpretation particularly useful?
5. If $\alpha = 0.05$, does that mean that 5\% of significant results are false?
