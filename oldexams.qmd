# Old exams

In the table below, you find links to PDFs of old exams. The first semester TECH3 was introduced was Spring 2025. The assessment form was then a 4-hour school exam, and we made three exams: One trial exam that students got to train for the exam (getting familiarized with the format), one ordinary school exam and one retake exam for those who did not pass. 

From the Spring 2026, we have moved over to a 6-hour digital school exam after feedback from the students.
