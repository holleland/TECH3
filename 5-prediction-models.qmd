## Slides

-   ["Explain vs predict"](video-pdfs/5/explain_vs_predict.pdf)
-   ["Prediction and overfitting"](video-pdfs/5/prediction_and_overfitting.pdf)
-   ["Confidence and prediction intervals"](video-pdfs/5/confidence_and_prediction_intervals.pdf)
-   ["Cross validation"](video-pdfs/5/crossvalidation.pdf)

## Control questions:

- What is your goal if you are concerned about model assumptions being fulfilled?
- What is your goal if you are mostly concerned with out-of-sample performance?
- What is overfitting and how can we avoid it?
- Which is widest - confidence interval of prediction interval?
- Why do we need a train-test split?
- What is the end-goal of a cross validation routine?
