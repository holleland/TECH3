### Problem 1

The diameter of a randomly selected mechanical nut is a random variable with mean 10 mm and standard deviation 0.04 mm. 

a) If $\bar X$ is the sample mean diameter of a random sample of $n=16$ nuts, where is the sampling distribution of $\bar X$ centered, and what is the standard deviation of the $\bar X$ distribution?

b) Answer the question in (a) for a sample size of $n=64$ nuts. 

c) For which of the two random samples from (a) or (b), is $\bar X$ more likely to be within 0.01 mm from 10 mm? Explain your reasoning.

Suppose the distrution of the diameter is normal. 

e) Calculate $P(9.99\le \bar X \le 10.01)$ when $n=16$.

a) 10 and 0.01. 

b) 10 and 0.005 

c) With less variability, the second sample is more closely centered near 10. 

d) $P(9.99\le \bar X \le 10.01)=P(\bar X \le 10.01)-P(\bar X \le 9.99) = 0.84-0.16= 0.68$, getting the numbers from the code below:


```{python}
from scipy import stats
import numpy as np
print(
  stats.norm.cdf(10.01, loc = 10, scale = 0.04/np.sqrt(16))-
  stats.norm.cdf(9.99, loc = 10, scale = 0.04/np.sqrt(16))
  )
```

e) $P(\bar X_{25}>10.01)=0.106$.

```{python}
print(
  1-stats.norm.cdf(10.01, loc = 10, scale = 0.04/np.sqrt(25))
  )
```

### Problem 4
The Central Limit Theorem states that the sample mean $\bar X$ follows an approximately normal distribution when the sample size is sufficiently large. More precisely, the theorem asserts that the standardized version of $\bar X$ given by $$\frac{\bar X-\mu}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}},$$ converges in distribution to the standard normal distribution as $n$ increases.

How does this relate to the Law of Large Numbers? If the standardized $\bar X$  follows an approximate standard normal distribution, what does this imply about the distribution of $\bar X$ itself?

<details>
<summary>Show solutions</summary>
The Law of Large numbers states that $\bar X$ will approach $\mu$ when $n$ becomes large. The central limit theorem implies that
$\bar X$ will follow a $N(\mu, \sigma^2/n)$ distribution asymptotically.

### Problem 5

Suppose $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n$ are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables from an exponential distribution with parameter $\lambda > 0$, i.e.,

$$f(x \mid \lambda) = \lambda e^{-\lambda x}, \quad x > 0.$$

Find the Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) for $\lambda$.

<details>
<summary>Show solutions</summary>

The likelihood function is:
$$L(\lambda) = \prod_{i=1}^{n} \lambda e^{-\lambda X_i} = \lambda^n e^{-\lambda \sum X_i}.$$

The log-likelihood function is:
$$\ell(\lambda) = n \log \lambda - \lambda \sum X_i.$$

Differentiating with respect to $\lambda$:
$$\frac{d\ell}{d\lambda} = \frac{n}{\lambda} - \sum X_i.$$

Setting it equal to zero:
$$\frac{n}{\lambda} = \sum X_i.$$

Solving for $\lambda$:
$$\hat{\lambda} = \frac{n}{\sum X_i}.$$

### Problem 6
Let $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n$ be i.i.d. random variables from a normal distribution with unknown mean $\mu$ and known variance $\sigma^2$. That is,
$$X_i \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2).$$
Find the MLE of $\mu$.


<details>
<summary>Show solutions</summary>
The likelihood function is:
$$L(\mu) = \prod_{i=1}^{n} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}} \exp \left( -\frac{(X_i - \mu)^2}{2\sigma^2} \right).$$

The log-likelihood function is:
$$\ell(\mu) = -\frac{n}{2} \log (2\pi\sigma^2) - \frac{1}{2\sigma^2} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (X_i - \mu)^2.$$

Differentiating with respect to $\mu$:
$$\frac{d\ell}{d\mu} = \frac{1}{\sigma^2} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (X_i - \mu).$$

Setting it equal to zero:
$$\sum_{i=1}^{n} (X_i - \mu) = 0.$$

Solving for $\mu$:
$$\hat{\mu} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i.$$

### Problem 7
Let $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n$ be i.i.d. random variables from a Bernoulli distribution with unknown parameter $p$. That is,
$$P(X_i = 1) = p, \quad P(X_i = 0) = 1 - p.$$
Find the MLE for $p$.

Hint: We can also write the Bernoulli distribution as $P(X=x) =p^x(1-p)^{1-x}$, where $x\in \{0,1\}$.


<details>
<summary>Show solutions</summary>

The likelihood function is:
$$L(p) = \prod_{i=1}^{n} p^{X_i} (1 - p)^{1 - X_i}.$$

The log-likelihood function is:
$$\ell(p) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i \log p + (1 - X_i) \log (1 - p).$$

Differentiating with respect to $p$:
$$\frac{d\ell}{dp} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{X_i}{p} - \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{1 - X_i}{1 - p}.$$

Setting it equal to zero:
$$\sum X_i \frac{1}{p} - \sum (1 - X_i) \frac{1}{1 - p} = 0.$$
Rearranging:
$$\sum X_i (1 - p) = (n - \sum X_i) p.$$

Solving for $p$:
$$\hat{p} = \frac{1}{n} \sum X_i.$$

### Problem 8
Let $\hat{\theta}$ be an estimator of a parameter $\theta$. The bootstrap estimate of the bias is given by:

$$\hat{\text{Bias}} = \frac{1}{B} \sum_{b=1}^{B} \hat{\theta}^*_b - \hat{\theta},$$

where $\hat{\theta}^*_b$ is the estimate from bootstrap sample $b$.

Use bootstrap resampling to estimate the bias of the maximum likelihood estimator of the variance;$$s^2=\frac1n \sum_{i}(x_i-\bar x)^2,$$ for a set of data $x_1,\ldots, x_n$.

Describe the procedure and discuss the sign of the bias. If you want to implement the code, use the following data set:

$$X = \{4.2, 3.9, 5.1, 4.8, 4.3, 5.0, 3.7, 4.5, 4.9, 4.6\}.$$

<details>
<summary>Show solutions</summary>

1. Compute the sample variance $s^2$ from the original dataset.
2. Generate 1000 bootstrap samples and compute $s^2$ for each.
3. Compute the bootstrap estimate of bias using the formula above.
4. Interpret the result: If the bias is positive, $s^2$ is underestimating the true variance; if negative, it is overestimating.

### Problem 9

When playing the casino game american roulette, there are 38 possible outcomes: 0,00, and 1-36. The 0 and 00 are colored green, while odd numbers from 1-35 are black and even numbers from 2-36 are red. 

a) What is the probability of winning if you bet on a black outcome?

A gambler has \$100 and bets \$1 each time he plays. He plays until he is either out of money or has doubled his money.

b) How would you construct a Monte Carlo simulation of a situation where you always bet on black, and want to find the probability of going bankrupt. 

c) What would the probability of the gambler doubling his money?

<details>
<summary>Show solutions</summary>

a) The probability of winning when betting on black is $18/38=0.474$

b) It would make sense to use a while loop and continue to simulate unless the gambler is bankrupt or has \$200. For simulate the game, use a Bernoulli distribution for each game with success probability $18/38=0.474$. If the Bernoulli variable is 1, increase the "bank" of the gambler by 1 dollar. If it is 0, decrease it by 1 dollar. Repeat the game 10 000 times and calculate the relative frequency of going bankrupt. 

c) In the end, there are only two outcomes of the experiment. Either the gambler goes bankrupt or he doubles his money. The probability of doubling the money, would therefore be 1-the probability of going bankrupt.

$$f(x|\theta) = \theta x^{\theta -1},\quad 0<\theta<\infty,\quad 0\le x\le1.$$
Find the MLE of $\theta$. 


<details>
<summary>Show solutions</summary>
$$L(\theta)=f(x_1,\ldots, x_n|\theta) = \theta^n \prod_{i=1}^nx_i^{\theta -1}$$
$$\log L = n\log \theta + (\theta-1)\sum_{i=1}^n\log x_i$$
$$\frac{\partial \log L}{\partial \theta} = \frac{n}{\theta} + \sum_{i=1}^n\log x_i=0$$
$$\widehat \theta = \frac{-n}{\sum_{i=1}^n \log x_i}.$$
