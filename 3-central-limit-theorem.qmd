## Control questions

1.  What does the central limit theorem tell us?
2.  What are the assumptions for the central limit theorem?
3.  What is the asymptotic variance of the mean?
4.  What is becoming large in the central limit theorem?
5.  Will a sum also be normally distributed when the sample size is large?
6.  Does the sampled data have to be generated from a normal distribution for the central limit theorem to hold?
